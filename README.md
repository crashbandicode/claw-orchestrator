> Memento fork: this release integrates upstream 7.6.0 while retaining Memento lifecycle reporting, Cursor support, native host launch fixes, and configurable/unlimited session capacity. Native and OpenCode effort settings are delivered through each engine's supported interface. See [effort validation](skills/references/memento-effort-validation.md) for tested routes and provider limitations. Codex app-server resumes use full native thread IDs and fail explicitly if the original thread cannot be resumed; see [session resume](skills/references/sessions.md#session-resume--fork).

# Claw Orchestrator

> A runtime for coding agents. Wrap Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Grok Build, OpenCode, or any custom CLI as persistent programmable sessions; coordinate them in multi-agent councils; run autonomous Planner / Coder / Reviewer loops; or hand a short structured interview to an Opus council that ships a deployed web app at `localhost:19000/forge/<slug>/`.

Coding CLIs are designed for humans at terminals. Claw Orchestrator turns them into headless engines and adds an orchestration layer on top: 78 tools, from single-session calls to multi-agent runs and generated web apps — reachable through the CLI, the OpenClaw gateway, the Model Context Protocol, or directly from TypeScript, and visible through an embedded three-tab dashboard.

## Features

| Capability                  | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reference                                                  |

| **Persistent Sessions**     | Long-lived coding agents kept alive across requests, with full context, tool, model, and worktree control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [`sessions.md`](./skills/references/sessions.md)           |
| **Multi-Engine Runtime**    | One interface over Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity (agy), Grok Build, OpenCode, and arbitrary custom CLIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [`multi-engine.md`](./skills/references/multi-engine.md)   |
| **Session Handoff**         | Move a live conversation to another engine or model — a stuck Claude session into Codex, an expensive model into a cheaper one. The new session picks up where the old one stopped, in the same workspace; the old one keeps running.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [`sessions.md`](./skills/references/sessions.md)           |
| **Multi-Agent Council**     | Parallel agents in isolated git worktrees, voting on consensus until they agree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [`council.md`](./skills/references/council.md)             |
| **Fan-out**                 | Run one task across N engine/model agents in parallel and collect their answers, with an optional synthesis pass — the cross-engine best-of-N / diverse-perspective primitive (no rounds or worktrees).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [`tools.md`](./skills/references/tools.md)                 |
| **ultracode**               | `session_start({ ultracode: true })` lets Claude orchestrate a dynamic JS workflow and fan out to subagents per task (Claude engine).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [`tools.md`](./skills/references/tools.md)                 |
| **Autoloop**                | Three-agent autonomous workspace iteration with independent engine/model selection for Planner, Coder, and Reviewer. Chat with the Planner; it spawns Coder + Reviewer into a self-iterating subloop and pushes you on regression, target-hit, or decision points.                                                                                                                                                                        | [`autoloop.md`](./skills/references/autoloop.md)           |
| **Ultraapp**                | A three-agent Opus council turns a short structured interview into a deployed web app — Tailwind UI, BYOK, file-queue runtime, smoke test, all live at `localhost:19000/forge/<slug>/`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [`ultraapp.md`](./skills/references/ultraapp.md)           |
| **Embedded Dashboard**      | Three-tab UI for Autoloop, Council, and Forge with sidebar lifecycle controls, per-run live event streaming, and cookie-based auth via a `/login` redirect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [`dashboard.md`](./skills/references/dashboard.md)         |
| **OpenAI-Compatible Proxy** | `POST /v1/chat/completions` accepts OpenAI-format requests and routes them to persistent sessions on the engine the model name selects, streaming replies back in OpenAI shape. Point any OpenAI-SDK client or webchat at the orchestrator without changing call sites.                                                                                                                                                                   | [`openai-compat.md`](./skills/references/openai-compat.md) |
| **Durable Run Kernel**      | Declarative workflows over `agent` / `fanout` / `council` / `verifier` / `human_gate` / `router` / `subflow` / `autoloop` / `ultraapp_*` nodes. Every state transition is checkpointed, so a run survives a process restart and resumes at the node boundary. Retry, per-node timeout, cancel, steer, and bounded loops come from the kernel.                                                                                             | [`workflow.md`](./skills/references/workflow.md)           |
| **Verification Plane**      | Acceptance contracts the runtime executes itself — commands, HTTP probes, screenshots, diff policy, file assertions — producing an evidence bundle on disk. A run carrying a contract cannot reach `completed` unless it passes, and one without a contract completes as `unverified` rather than claiming success. The tests a contract runs are held to what the run started with, so a run cannot pass by editing them.                | [`verification.md`](./skills/references/verification.md)   |
| **Run Ledger & Spend Caps** | Every turn on every engine is appended to a durable JSONL ledger — engine, model, tokens, cost, duration, and the council/fanout/autoloop it belonged to — queryable with `clawo runs` after a restart. Rows carry both the engine's self-report (`ok`) and the runtime's own measurement (`verified`), kept apart. `maxBudgetUsd` is enforced by the runtime, so a cap holds on Codex, Grok, agy and OpenCode too, not just Claude Code. | [`observability.md`](./skills/references/observability.md) |

The full 78-tool surface is enumerated in [`tools.md`](./skills/references/tools.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @enderfga/claw-orchestrator
clawo serve   # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:18796/dash
```

The server generates an access token at `~/.openclaw/server-token`; open `http://127.0.0.1:18796/login?token=<token>&redirect=/dash` once to sign in the browser.

```ts
import { SessionManager } from '@enderfga/claw-orchestrator';

const manager = new SessionManager();
await manager.startSession({ name: 'fix-tests', engine: 'claude', cwd: '/project' });
const result = await manager.sendMessage('fix-tests', 'Fix the failing tests');
```

---

## Integrations

### Standalone CLI

```bash
clawo serve                                            # dashboard + HTTP server on :18796
clawo session-start fix-tests --engine claude --cwd .  # start a session
clawo session-send fix-tests "Fix the failing tests"   # send into it
```

Every command is documented in [`cli.md`](./skills/references/cli.md).

### OpenClaw Plugin

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enderfga/claw-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs via npm, registers the plugin in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, restarts the gateway. All 78 tools become available to every OpenClaw agent.

### Model Context Protocol Server

```bash
npm install -g @enderfga/claw-orchestrator   # clawo-mcp is now on PATH
```

Register `clawo-mcp` with any MCP-compatible host: Hermes Agent, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue, Zed, Windsurf, Goose, and others. The open-session limit is configurable with `CLAWO_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` (default `5`, `0` = unlimited). Per-host stdio-config snippets and the `CLAWO_MCP_TOOLS` allowlist for tight tool budgets are in [`mcp.md`](./skills/references/mcp.md).

### Agent Client Protocol Agent

```bash
clawo acp        # or the dedicated binary: clawo-acp
```

MCP gives tools _to_ an agent; ACP makes you _be_ the agent. `clawo acp` speaks
[Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) over stdio, so Zed, JetBrains,
Neovim, Emacs, the VS Code ACP extension — or `dsh` via its `subagent-acp` provider —
can drive Claw Orchestrator as their coding agent.

The model selector is grouped by engine, so one dropdown holds Claude, Codex and Grok
models at once and switching it switches engine mid-session; `/council`, `/ultraplan`
and `/ultrareview` run multi-agent orchestrations from the chat box. Setup, the `dsh` YAML
block, and the cancellation and permission limitations are in
[`acp.md`](./skills/references/acp.md).

## Engine Compatibility

| Engine      | CLI        | Tested Version |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Claude Code | `claude`   | 2.1.284        |
| Codex       | `codex`    | 0.159.0        |
| Antigravity | `agy`      | 1.2.13         |
| Grok Build  | `grok`     | 1.0.44         |
| OpenCode    | `opencode` | 1.18.33        |
| Custom CLI  | any        | —              |

Any coding CLI that runs as a subprocess can be wired up as a custom engine — see [`multi-engine.md`](./skills/references/multi-engine.md#custom-engine-engine-custom).

---

## How the engine table stays current

The versions above are not typed in — they are what the weekly sweep last ran. `scripts/sweep.ts`
measures each core engine's installed, pinned and upstream version, diffs the flags the wrapper
passes against the binary's `--help`, runs one live turn **through the real wrapper class**, smokes
the ACP and MCP entry points, and checks `src/models.ts` against both vendors' published price
tables. It contains no model call, so the check that reports a wrapper as broken does not share the
wrapper's failure modes.

`scripts/sweep-workflow.json` wraps the same script as a durable run on this project's own kernel:
verifier → router → an agent that drafts the alignment on a `sweep/<date>` branch → a human gate.
A person reviews and merges; the orchestrator does not edit its own code unattended.

## License

MIT — see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

Cursor effort discovery uses both its legacy CLI listing and native ACP parameterized catalog. Grok 4.7 and other parameterized models retain their exact requested effort even when omitted from `--list-models`; discovery does not create an agent conversation.
