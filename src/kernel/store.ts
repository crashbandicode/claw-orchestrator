/**
 * Durable run store.
 *
 * Layout, one directory per run under `~/.claw-orchestrator/wf/<runId>/`:
 *
 *   spec.json      the WorkflowSpec, written once at creation, never mutated
 *   run.json       the mutable checkpoint, rewritten atomically on every transition
 *   events.jsonl   append-only audit + stream source
 *   nodes/<id>/    per-node artifacts
 *   evidence/<id>/ evidence bundles (see verify/evidence.ts)
 *
 * Splitting the immutable spec from the mutable checkpoint is what carries crash
 * recovery: if `run.json` is missing or half-written, the state is rebuilt by
 * replaying `events.jsonl` against `spec.json`. The atomic rewrite makes that
 * path rare; the replay makes it usually survivable.
 *
 * The checkpoint and the events it describes are written by the same
 * transaction, so they cannot disagree: a commit that reports `committed` has
 * both, and one that does not has neither. That was not always true — the event
 * append used to swallow its own errors while the replay treated the same log as
 * authoritative, which is a contradiction sitting in the recovery path. The
 * replay is now a plain fallback for a lost `run.json`; a run that lost both it
 * and the log is unrecoverable, and `loadRun` returns undefined rather than
 * inventing a state.
 *
 * There is exactly one way to write to a run — `commit()` — and it is not
 * optional: the checkpoint writer and the event appender are module-private, and
 * a batch is published by a single atomic directory rename rather than by a
 * sequence of writes that can each fail on their own. `atomicWriteJson` replaces
 * four near-identical implementations that had grown across the codebase
 * (`session-manager.ts` sync + async variants, `ultraapp/store.ts`,
 * `ultraapp/patcher.ts`); the tmp-name shape is kept from the ultraapp one,
 * whose comment records the CI bug it fixed: a reader catching a plain
 * `writeFile` mid-flight and parsing a truncated object.

// be decoration without it.
//
// The capability is a `RunGuard`, naming four things, all checked on every
// write:
//
//   incarnationId  which *creation* of this run id this is
//   ownerId        which RunKernel instance (never the pid — see `RunLease`)
//   acquisitionId  which claim by that owner
//   fence          monotonic within the incarnation, for ordering and logs
//

// another with the same id and the directory — fence counter included — is
// gone, so the new run's first fence is 1 again and a stale attempt still
// holding `{ownerId, fence: 1}` from the old run became valid a second time.
// That is a textbook ABA, and not hypothetical: an abandoned timed-out attempt
// outlives its run by construction.
//
// Two distinctions this module is careful about, because collapsing either one
// caused a real failure:
//
//   *Not the owner* is permanent; *could not take the lock* is transient. They
//   are separate outcomes (`superseded` vs `blocked`), and a caller that treats
//   a millisecond of contention as a loss stops forever while still holding its
//   lease — so nothing can take the run over either.
//
//   *Committed* means the whole batch is durable, not that most of it was
//   attempted. A batch is staged in a scratch directory and published by a
//   single atomic directory rename; the rename is the commit point, and what
//   follows is replayable application of an already-committed transaction.
