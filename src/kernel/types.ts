 * union (`CouncilSession.status`, `FanoutSession.status`, `UltraplanResult.status`,
 * `UltrareviewResult.status`, ultraapp's `RunMode`, `AutoloopStatus`) with no
 * overlapping vocabulary, so "is it done" had six different answers and no
 * cross-mode listing was possible. These types replace that.
 *
 * The important distinction encoded here is between *finishing* and *being
 * right*. `RunState` says whether the work stopped; `RunOutcome` says whether
 * anything checked it. A run with no acceptance contract finishes `completed` /
 * `unverified` — it says it does not know, which is not the same as success.
