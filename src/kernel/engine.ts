/**
 * The run kernel.
 *
 * A durable executor for workflow runs. It owns what the existing state machines
 * each owned separately and differently: what is running, what to do when a step
 * fails, when to give up, how to stop, and — the part none of them had — how to
 * come back after the process dies.
 *
 * Every mode goes through it. `council_start`, `fanout_start`, `ultraplan_start`,
 * `ultrareview_start` and `autoloop_start` each create a run here; the engines
 * they wrap (`Council`, `Fanout`, the autoloop dispatcher) still do the work,
 * but they no longer own a lifecycle. What that replaced: five result maps, four
 * 30-minute eviction timers, a 5-second poller, two `Set`s fencing a start
 * against a delete, and two incompatible ways of listing past runs across
 * processes.
 *
 * Durability contract, stated precisely: every state transition is checkpointed
 * (atomic `run.json`) and appended to `events.jsonl` before the next step
 * begins, and `resume` restarts at the last node boundary. That makes node
 * execution **at-least-once**, not exactly-once — there is no idempotency key,
 * no attempt lease, and no side-effect commit marker, so a node that died after
 * writing files but before its checkpoint runs again from the top. Workflows
 * whose nodes are not safe to repeat need to make them safe.
 *
 * Ownership contract, equally precisely: this class never writes to a run
 * directly. It holds a `RunGuard` from the store and every change — checkpoint,
 * event, node artifact, terminal verdict — goes through `RunTxn`, which applies
 * the change to a *copy*, commits it under the guard, and adopts the copy only
 * if the disk accepted it. There is no code path from here to `run.json` that
 * skips that, because the raw writers are no longer exported. An owner that has
 * been superseded therefore cannot change the run in memory either: its record
 * stops advancing at the last write the disk agreed to.
 *
 * Control flow is linear with an explicit `router` node for branches and loops.
 * Parallelism is the `fanout` node rather than a general parallel/join construct:
 * fan-out is the shape every existing mode actually needed, and a join barrier
 * would add failure modes (partial joins, orphaned branches) that nothing here
 * would exercise.
 *
 * What a node timeout can and cannot do: it stops the kernel waiting and marks
 * the node failed, but an in-flight agent turn is owned by the session layer and
 * finishes on its own schedule. The kernel does not pretend otherwise.
