/**
 * `verifier` node — the runtime checks the work itself.
 *
 * This is the node that makes `completed` mean something. It resolves a contract
 * (inline, or the workflow-level one), runs every check, writes an evidence
 * bundle, and reports pass/fail. Its verdict — not an agent's vote, not a regex
 * over prose — is what the kernel turns into `RunOutcome`.
 *
 * The optional fix-on-red loop spawns a repair session and re-runs the checks.
 * The fixer's own claim to have fixed it is ignored: only the re-run counts.
