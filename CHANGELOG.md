# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [7.6.0-memento.1] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Merge upstream 7.6.0 and its durable workflow kernel while preserving Memento lifecycle events, council identity, native Windows launch helpers, lightweight installation, and zero-as-unlimited session capacity.
- Add explicit Cursor routes for Grok 4.7, Composer 2.5 (standard/fast), and Gemini 3.8 Flash High. Preserve complete NVIDIA gateway IDs when routing to OpenCode.

### Fixed

- Send Codex app-server session and turn reasoning effort through its native protocol, including none/minimal/max/ultra.
- Select Cursor effort from its installed model catalog; fail clearly when the requested family/effort is unavailable.
- Expose OpenCode provider-specific effort variants, including default, with a checked gateway configuration reference. Use native Anthropic Messages for adaptive Claude thinking and OpenAI Responses for reasoning models.
- Emit Memento terminal workflow status when the upstream kernel actually finishes a run; retain child identity and unlimited fanout behavior.


## [7.6.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Unified optional reasoning-effort bindings for orchestrated agents.** Fan-out agents and
  built-in workflow agents/reviewers now accept per-agent `effort`, matching Council's existing
  support. Autoloop accepts fixed `planner_effort`, `coder_effort`, and `reviewer_effort`; these
  survive durable resume and role reset, and Planner engine/model overrides cannot replace them.
  Omitting effort preserves existing defaults and older stored runs remain compatible.

### Fixed

- **Fan-out personas no longer replace the shared task.** Agents can now receive optional
  `persona` role instructions composed before the common task, while a non-empty per-agent
  `prompt` retains its documented full-override behavior. Both fields remain distinct in the
  durable workflow spec, so resumed fan-outs reproduce the same message.

### Changed

- **The `sonnet` alias resolves to Claude Sonnet 5.5.** Claude Code 2.1.284 made `claude-sonnet-5-5`
  the model `--model sonnet` runs, so the alias moved with it and the model is registered at its
  published rates ($2/$10 per Mtok, $0.20 cache reads, 1M-token context). These match Sonnet 5, so
  no cost figure changes; sessions started with `sonnet` now report the model they really run.
  `claude-sonnet-5` stays selectable by id.
- Tested with Claude Code 2.1.284, Codex 0.159.0, agy 1.2.13, grok 1.0.44 and OpenCode 1.18.33.

## [7.5.6] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **An agy turn that started a background task no longer fails as a timeout.** Since agy 1.2.9 a
  headless run whose agent started a background task — a dev server, a watcher — stays open until
  its `--print-timeout` deadline, and prints the reply only when it exits. The wrapper set that
  deadline 5s after its own timer, so it killed the run first and reported a finished turn as a
  timeout. agy's deadline is now set just inside the send timeout, so agy ends the background task
  and delivers the reply. A run that reaches the deadline while the agent is still working is
  reported as a timeout: agy marks it `SUCCESS` with a partial reply and says otherwise only on
  stderr.
- **An effort-qualified agy model is priced as its base model.** A session on
  `gemini-3.1-pro-high` was not found in the model registry and fell back to the Gemini Flash rates;
  it is now priced as `gemini-3.1-pro`.

### Changed

- Tested with Claude Code 2.1.283, Codex 0.157.1 and agy 1.2.11.

## [7.5.5] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A resumed workflow continues at the node it was on.** Resume picked the first `pending` node in
  declaration order, and a node on a branch the run never took stays `pending` for good — so a run
  that died inside one node could come back at a contingency `human_gate` declared above it, park
  there, and re-run earlier nodes once approved. The resume point now comes from the run record: the
  node that was running or waiting at a gate; the successor of a node that finished just before the
  process died (a router is evaluated again, since its choice is not recorded); and the first node
  for a run that has not started, or one restarted with `restart`. Reported by @dhroco in #117.
- **Approving a gate works after a restart.** A run parked at a `human_gate` is on disk but not live
  once the server restarts, and `workflow_approve` returned `{ answered: false }` without doing
  anything until the run was resumed by hand. The answer is now attached to the gate the run was
  parked at and the run is resumed; it takes the answer when it reaches that gate. (#117)
- **Steers survive a restart.** The steer queue lived in memory, so a steer that had arrived but not
  been taken was lost on a restart, although the run's log recorded it. A node now records how many
  steers it held when it finishes, and on resume every steer no finished node consumed is queued
  again — including one held by a node that died, which goes to that node's retry. (#117)

## [7.5.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Ultrareview reviewers are read-only on every engine.** They were started with `permissionMode:
'plan'`, which constrains Claude only, so a reviewer assigned to another engine through `engines`
  ran under that engine's default sandbox — for Codex, one that can write — in the project directory
  it was reviewing. Reviewers now also get `sandboxMode: 'read-only'`, which reaches the session
  through the fan-out, and `ultrareview_start` refuses `grok`, which declines a read-only session
  rather than approximating one.
- **A grok session on the OpenAI-compatible endpoint is replayed like the other resuming engines.**
  A grok session whose first turn failed before grok returned a session id counted as live, so the
  next turn went out without the conversation before it. It now waits for the id, as codex, agy
  and opencode already did.
- **Browsers can send `X-Session-Id` and `X-Session-Reset` cross-origin.** The CORS preflight now
  allows both headers, which the OpenAI-compatible endpoint uses to key and reset a conversation.
- **`session_start` declares `restricted` and `ignoreUserConfig`**, so a host that builds calls from
  the tool schema can pass them.
- **The ACP model selector labels Grok Build and no longer offers the legacy Cursor engine.**
- **Tool and CLI descriptions match the code:** they list the current engines, `council_start`
  gives `maxTurnsPerAgent`'s real default (50), and `ultrareview_start` says 1–20 reviewers.
- **The reference docs match the code.** Among the corrections: the embedded server has
  authentication on by default; the ultraapp tools take `runId`; `clawo session-start` lists only
  flags it has; the rate limit is 300 requests per minute; ultrareview is a fan-out of read-only
  reviewers rather than a council; `maxTurnsPerAgent` for a council defaults to 50; the autoloop
  quick start targets `clawo serve`; and an autoloop acceptance contract is library-level only.

### Changed

- **Autoloop's email fallback runs the script named by `AUTOLOOP_EMAIL_SCRIPT`**, as
  `bash "$AUTOLOOP_EMAIL_SCRIPT" -s "<subject>"` with the body on stdin. Unset, the email tier is
  skipped like the WeChat and WhatsApp tiers; set to a missing file, it logs a warning.

## [7.5.3] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **Registered Claude Opus 5.5, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna, and moved the `opus` alias.** Claude Code
  2.1.280 made Opus 5.5 the model `--model opus` resolves to (confirmed against the binary), and
  Codex 0.156.1 added both new GPT-6 tiers. Opus 5.5 breaks the flat Opus pricing this registry had
  relied on: $4/$20 per Mtok against Opus 5's $5/$25, and its cache reads are 5% of input rather
  than the usual 10%. Every alias session — the autoloop Planner, the ultraplan default — was being
  priced at the older, higher rate, which is the number `maxBudgetUsd` gates on. All figures come
  from the vendors' published price tables, and each has a reverse assertion in the tests.

### Fixed

- **An Autoloop left idle no longer fails its next message.** Past `sessionTtlMinutes` the manager
  evicts the role sessions while the dispatcher still believed them started, so the next message
  failed with "Session not found". The Planner, Coder and Reviewer are now started again under the
  same name, which resumes the persisted conversation. From @caoxuandungecom in #110.

- **Stopping a one-shot session on Windows ends the whole process tree.** `kill` ended only the
  process it was given and left the engine CLI's own children running. Session cleanup, and an
  Antigravity turn killed by its timeout, now use `taskkill /T /F`, bounded at five seconds so a
  hung taskkill cannot stall the server, with `kill` as the fallback. (#110)

- **Autoloop runs that are not running in this process say so.** `GET /autoloop/<id>/state`
  returns `live`. An event stream for a run that has already ended closes at once instead of
  staying open with nothing left to send, and tells `EventSource` not to reconnect.
  `POST /autoloop/<id>/chat` to a stored but idle run names `POST /autoloop/<id>/resume`, while an
  unknown id stays plain "not found". The dashboard marks such a run inactive, disables its input,
  and offers Resume — for a paused run, only when it is paused on a timed-out send, the one pause
  resume acts on. (#110)

## [7.5.2] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Antigravity empty-response errors now name the denied tools.** When a turn fails with an
  empty response after a tool permission denial, the error message includes the denied tool
  names parsed from the log. A name is echoed only when it is shaped like a tool identifier; the
  generic message is kept when none is, so the error still carries no free text from agy's log.

- **`appendSystemPrompt` now reaches Codex, Antigravity and OpenCode sessions.** None of the three
  CLIs has a system-prompt flag, and the option was dropped for them without a word — on the
  `session_start` tool, and for every council seat on those engines, whose whole charter travels
  this way: identity, persona, the claim protocol, the report format, and "never push". It now leads
  the first message of a conversation, and is not repeated on later turns or on a resumed
  conversation, which already carries it. A user turn binds less firmly than a system prompt; it is
  the strongest channel these CLIs offer. `codex-app` does the same on a fresh thread. Claude Code
  (`--append-system-prompt`) and Grok (`--rules`) are unchanged.

- **Council no longer writes `.claude/CLAUDE.md` into its worktrees.** Each seat's identity and
  workspace boundary lived in a generated `<worktree>/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — a file only Claude Code
  reads, which replaced a project's own `.claude/CLAUDE.md` inside the worktree, and which an agent's
  `git add -A` could commit into the project. The workspace boundary is now part of the charter
  (`configs/council-system-prompt.md`, with a new `{{projectDir}}` placeholder), which reaches every
  engine.

## [7.5.1] - 2026-09-20

Weekly engine sweep: Claude Code 2.1.274 → 2.1.278, Codex 0.154.0 → 0.155.1, Antigravity 1.2.5 →
1.2.7; Grok Build and OpenCode were already current. Every live turn passed through the real
wrapper, the ACP and MCP handshakes are clean, and the model registry matched both vendors'
published prices (26 models, no drift). No engine's flag surface changed.

### Fixed

- **A resumed Claude session no longer charges its whole history to the next turn.** Claude Code
  2.1.277 made a headless process started with `--resume` restore the totals the resumed session
  saved at exit, where it used to begin at zero. The wrapper reads `total_cost_usd` as a running
  total and advances spend by the difference, so with no earlier figure to subtract it billed the
  first report of a resumed process in full. Measured on 2.1.278: a turn reported $0.363044, and
  the same session resumed in a new process reported $0.386463 for a turn whose own usage was
  $0.023419 — a 16x over-report, on every model switch and every session recovered after a
  restart, against the number `maxBudgetUsd` gates on. A resumed process's first report is now
  taken as a baseline, and the turn carrying it keeps the registry estimate.

### Changed

- **Antigravity's headless timeout is now entirely ours to set.** 1.2.6 changed the default for a
  `-p` run from five minutes to unlimited. The wrapper already derives `--print-timeout` from the
  send timeout, so no behaviour changes here — but that flag is now the only bound on a stuck turn
  rather than a tightening of one agy would have applied anyway.

## [7.5.0] - 2026-09-17

Weekly engine sweep: Claude Code 2.1.271 → 2.1.274, Antigravity 1.2.2 → 1.2.5, Grok Build 1.0.30 →
1.0.34; Codex and OpenCode were already current. Every live turn passed through the real wrapper and
the model registry matched both vendors' published prices. Most of this release fixes accounting and
concurrency that the run ledger and the session cap had been getting wrong, and it adds protection for
the tests an acceptance contract runs.

### Added

- **Protected tests.** In a workflow run, a contract with a `command` check now refutes the run when
  something that decides what its tests do changed during it — a loosened assertion, a deleted test,
  a `conftest.py` added beside existing tests, or a script the checks run pointed at something that
  exits 0. The run records its tests when it starts by hashing their bytes, and the required check
  `protected-tests` compares against that record before the other checks run, so a developer's
  uncommitted test edits stay theirs and a test that restores itself is still caught. Adding tests,
  packages and unrelated scripts stays allowed, installed dependencies are not considered, and
  `"protectTests": false` opts out when changing tests is the task. Tests inside source files, test
  settings in general config files, files hidden by `.gitignore`, and source that special-cases the
  test environment are not caught.

### Fixed

- **The session cap held only for sessions started one at a time.** It was checked against the live
  sessions, and a session joins them once its process is up, so every start launched together — a
  fan-out's agents, a council round — passed the check: eight agents meant eight engine processes
  whatever `maxConcurrentSessions` said. A start in flight now holds its slot. Fan-out and Council run
  no more agents at once than there are free slots and queue the rest, so a run wider than the cap
  waits rather than failing. Because queued agents take longer in total, `fanout` and `council` nodes
  gained `agentTimeoutMs`, and `fanout_start`, `ultrareview_start` and `council_start` size the node
  timeout for the worst case instead of reusing one agent's timeout, which had also been cutting
  multi-round councils short; the built-in `fanout`, `council` and `solve` workflows get the same
  bounds. An aborted or timed-out fan-out starts none of the agents still waiting, and a timed-out
  council — including UltraApp's synthesis council, which a cancelled build now reaches — opens no
  further round.
- **Claude Code tool calls were reported twice.** Each `tool_use` block arrives on
  `content_block_start` with an empty input and again as an `assistant` event with its input, and both
  were counted and emitted: `toolCalls` doubled, and ACP clients received two `tool_call` updates per
  call, the first without arguments. A call is now reported once, with its input. The same applied to
  persistent custom engines.
- **Claude Code `toolErrors` was always 0.** Tool results arrive inside `user` messages rather than as
  top-level events; failed results are counted from there.
- **A turn the session did not send could be returned as the reply to the next send.** When a
  background workflow finishes, or a message from another Claude Code session arrives, the CLI runs a
  turn of its own, and its result resolved whichever send was waiting. Each message now carries an id
  that the CLI echoes on the result answering it, so a result resolves only its own send — including a
  message the CLI folds into a turn it started itself — and neither the reply to a message sent
  without waiting nor a late reply to a send that timed out is handed to the next one. Without ids, a
  result tagged with a non-human `origin` resolves none. Such turns do not count toward
  `turnsSucceeded`; their cost does. The `ultracode` docs now say a workflow's send returns at
  launch, and no longer claim the CLI rejects `--effort ultracode`.
- **Ledger rows.** A Claude Code session with no explicit model recorded `model: "default"`; it now
  records the model named in the CLI's `init` event, and never the placeholder. `turn` is now the
  index of the send — it was Claude Code's count of `user` events, which advances once per tool-result
  batch. `getRunLedger` with both `verified` and `limit` applied the limit first and could return
  fewer rows than asked while matching rows existed.
- **Claude Code's `[1m]` model suffix** (`claude-opus-5[1m]`, `opus[1m]`) is read as the model itself
  for pricing and as a 1M window, instead of falling back to Sonnet pricing with a warning on every
  lookup.
- **A child process that exits without reading its input no longer crashes the orchestrator**, and
  output is decoded as a stream, so a multi-byte character split across chunks is no longer
  corrupted.
- **The test suite wrote into the real home directory**: ledger rows, council transcripts, and the
  persisted-session and PID files a running orchestrator restores from. Every test file now runs
  with a private `HOME`, and test workers run with a bounded heap.
- **The weekly sweep could pass without knowing the upstream version.** Its Codex lookup scanned the
  newest 15 GitHub releases, which Codex's prereleases had filled, so the upstream column read "?" and
  the run still passed. It now reads a full page, takes Grok Build's upstream from its updater's
  check-only mode, and treats an empty lookup as a regression.

## [7.4.1] - 2026-09-15

Weekly engine sweep: Claude Code 2.1.269 → 2.1.271, OpenCode 1.18.30 → 1.18.31. Every live turn
passed through the real wrapper, the model registry matched both vendors' published prices, and no
engine's flag surface changed.

### Fixed

- **`SessionConfig.agents` accepts every field the CLI does.** The type named only `description` and
  `prompt`, while Claude Code's `--agents` schema also takes `tools`, `model`, `maxTurns`,
  `background`, `memory`, `isolation`, `effort`, and — from 2.1.271 — `omitClaudeMd`, which runs a
  subagent without the user, project and local CLAUDE.md files. Definitions were always handed to the
  CLI verbatim, so tool and MCP callers could already pass them; TypeScript callers could not. The
  new `AgentDefinition` names `omitClaudeMd` and passes the rest through, and a test pins the
  verbatim hand-over so a field the CLI adds next is not dropped on the way.
- **`gpt-4.1` is registered** (`2 / 0.5 / 8`, 1,047,576-token window). It is priced by OpenAI and
  reachable from Codex under API-key auth, and was being priced as the Sonnet fallback with a 200K
  window.
- **The sweep's missing-model check never ran.** Added in 7.1.1 to flag a model that a vendor prices
  and an engine can select but this registry does not know, it resolved the engine binary against the
  working directory instead of `PATH`, found no binary, and reported nothing — which reads exactly
  like "no new models". It now resolves through `PATH`, covers Claude as well as Codex (a new Claude
  model would otherwise have gone unnoticed until someone asked whether it had shipped), skips rows
  the vendor marks retired, and reports a binary it cannot scan as a regression rather than an empty
  result. Its first real run found `gpt-4.1`.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-09-13

Antigravity turns that did nothing no longer pass as successes, and Autoloop's Planner writes its
plan, goal and spawn as one step. Thanks to @ajmtrz (#105).

### Fixed

- **Antigravity no longer treats an exit-0 empty response as a successful
  turn.** The invariant applies at the adapter boundary, so Autoloop and every
  other SessionManager caller now reject missing, blank, and whitespace-only
  replies while keeping a captured conversation id available for an explicit
  retry. agy 1.1.26 can produce this shape when plan mode soft-denies a tool
  confirmation; a narrow marker from the freshly cleared current-turn log adds
  a fixed sanitized diagnosis without exposing the log. Recovery does not
  retry automatically or widen the Planner beyond `--mode plan`. agy 1.2.2 can
  report the same denial with `status: SUCCESS` and a non-empty reply; refused
  tool names now flow through `SendResult.permissionDenials` without dropping
  that reply.
- **Autoloop Planner control batches are in-band-only and failure-atomic for
  artifacts.** The dispatcher prevalidates the complete fenced-control batch,
  rejects duplicate plan/goal/spawn controls, stages exact `plan.md` and
  `goal.json` bytes as one rollback-capable replacement, and materializes both
  before at most one subagent spawn. A malformed block or artifact failure now
  leaves prior files unchanged and emits neither spawn nor an initial
  directive; the Planner's existing read-only isolation is unchanged.

### Added

- **A real-subprocess agy 1.1.26 Planner regression fixture** reproduces the
  first-turn soft denial and blank result, then verifies that the resumed
  conversation returns fenced plan/goal/spawn controls, exact artifacts exist
  before the single spawn, and no failed-turn effect leaks through.

## [7.3.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **`session_handoff` — continue a conversation on another engine.** Starts a new session on the
  target engine (or the same engine with another model) in the source's working directory, and
  carries the conversation into it, so the new agent picks up where the old one stopped. The source
  keeps running untouched; the two go separate ways from there.
  - No engine can resume another's session, and each keeps its history in its own undocumented
    on-disk format, so the conversation travels as text: a `<conversation_history>` block in front
    of the new session's first message, after which the new engine holds it itself. Nothing is
    written into either engine's session store, and it works across every engine, custom ones
    included. Every turn in the block is fenced against the block's own tags.
  - What was said is recorded per session as it is sent and answered. The engine's history buffer
    is not used for this: it is capped by event count, and on a long session the opening request is
    the first thing it drops.
  - When the conversation is longer than `maxChars` (default 240,000 characters), the opening
    request is kept, the newest turns fill the rest, and one line records how many turns in
    between were left out.
  - The new session inherits the engine-neutral settings — permission and sandbox mode, effort,
    spend cap, system prompts, extra directories — and none that were written for the source
    engine. A second handoff carries the whole conversation, not only the part the middle session
    saw. A first send that fails on the new engine keeps the history for the retry.
  - Verified end to end over MCP against the installed engines: a fact planted in a Claude session
    was recalled by Codex after a handoff, and again by Claude after a second handoff back, which
    also named Codex as the engine it had taken over from.

## [7.2.0] - 2026-09-13

Weekly engine sweep. Five engines upgraded in place, every live turn through the real wrapper,
registry 25 models with no drift.

### Added

- **`SendResult.permissionDenials` — the tool calls the engine refused during a turn.** A refused
  call does not fail the turn. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.269 with `--permission-prompts none`,
  which a session gets whenever no prompt tool is configured: asked to write a file, the turn ended
  `subtype: 'success'` with `is_error: false`, the Bash call listed as denied in the result event, and
  no file on disk. It counted in `turnsSucceeded` and set no `error`. `sendMessage` — the one path
  every caller goes through — dropped that event, so council agents, autoloop roles, and MCP callers
  all saw a clean success. The field is present only when something was refused, and it reaches
  `session_send` and every other caller unchanged.

### Changed

- Tested versions: Claude Code 2.1.260 → 2.1.269, Codex 0.153.2 → 0.154.0, Antigravity
  1.1.25 → 1.2.2, Grok Build 1.0.13 → 1.0.30, OpenCode 1.18.27 → 1.18.30.
- Codex 0.154.0's `--worktree` is deliberately not passed. Measured: edits land in a
  Codex-managed worktree on a detached HEAD rather than in the session's working directory, and the
  event stream does not report where. Acceptance contracts and evidence read the session's working
  directory, so they would verify an untouched tree.

## [7.1.1] - 2026-09-04

The weekly sweep now checks the model registry, and its first run found two more wrong prices.

### Fixed

- **`o4-mini` was priced at half its real cost.** OpenAI publishes four identically shaped tables
  per model — Standard, Batch, Flex, Fast — and this entry had been copied from the Batch column:
  `0.55 / 4.4` against a Standard `1.1 / 4.4`. Every run on it under-reported spend by 2x.
- **`o3` and `o4-mini` had no cached rate**, so cached reads were billed into the report at the
  full input price instead of a quarter of it.

### Added

- **The sweep diffs `src/models.ts` against both vendors' published price tables.** Until now it
  only checked engines, so a repriced model was invisible to it: a wrong cost does not crash, it
  just stays wrong. Both vendors publish their tables as markdown, so this needs no model to read
  them. A model is reported as missing only when the vendor prices it _and_ the engine binary can
  select it, which is the same test used by hand to keep `gpt-5.6-pro` and `gpt-5.6-cyber` out.
  A price source that cannot be fetched is reported as a regression rather than skipped — an
  unverified pass is what let a spent Grok quota carry a pin for a week.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-09-04

Weekly engine sweep. Five engines, zero regressions, every live turn through the real wrapper.

### Fixed

- **The GPT-5.6 tiers were priced at their launch rates.** OpenAI repriced all three after launch
  and this registry kept the old numbers, so reported cost was wrong for every run on them — Luna
  by 5x. Now Sol/bare `4 / 0.4 / 20`, Terra `2 / 0.2 / 12`, Luna `0.2 / 0.02 / 1.2`, cross-checked
  against both the pricing table and each model's own docs page. The test that was supposed to
  catch this pinned the launch literals; it now asserts bare `gpt-5.6` equals `gpt-5.6-sol`, which
  is the actual invariant and survives the next repricing.

### Added

- **`gpt-6-astra`** — 1,050,000-token window, `10 / 1 / 50`. Absent from Codex 0.153.0 and present
  in 0.153.2, so baselining the sweep on the installed binary rather than on upstream would have
  hidden it for another week.

### Changed

- Tested versions: Claude Code 2.1.259 → 2.1.260, Codex 0.153.0 → 0.153.2. Antigravity 1.1.25,
  Grok 1.0.13, and OpenCode 1.18.27 unchanged. Grok's live turn passed this week — last week it
  could only be carried unverified, because a spent free tier hangs silently instead of erroring.
- Deliberately still unregistered: `gpt-5.6-pro` (in the Codex binary, no docs page and no pricing
  row) and `gpt-5.6-cyber` (documented, but no engine here can select it).

## [7.0.0] - 2026-09-04

Two contributed fixes for defects that were invisible from inside the project, plus the
follow-ups they surfaced. Thanks to @ajmtrz for both, and for finding them by running this
orchestrator's own autoloop against the repository.

### Fixed

- **Tool results reaching an OpenClaw host were empty.** Every handler returned its raw payload,
  but the host reads `result.content`, so tools ran — with their side effects — and the model was
  handed nothing back. All 77 registrations now pass through one adapter that emits text content
  plus the original structured value in `details`, serializes BigInt safely, preserves an
  already-wrapped result, and lets handler errors propagate unchanged.
- **MCP tool results no longer carry the payload twice.** With handlers now normalized, the MCP
  bridge's own `JSON.stringify` would have shipped the data once escaped inside a text block and
  again under `details`. It forwards the content blocks instead.
- **An autoloop node no longer dies at 30 minutes.** The kernel's generic default node timeout
  applied to autoloop nodes, which are built to run for hours or days. Autoloops now own their
  timeout policy; an explicitly configured node timeout is still honoured.
- **A timed-out agent send is recoverable instead of fatal.** Sends gained a bounded per-message
  deadline, a renewable inactivity lease, and an absolute run lifetime cap. A genuine send
  deadline parks the run in `awaiting_resume` with the pending dispatch identity, so a resume can
  raise the deadline and continue rather than restart. Explicit stop and hard-timeout terminal
  states win races against a late timeout.
- **The retained dispatch cache is bounded.** Deduplicating logical dispatches for a run's whole
  lifetime meant holding every iteration's full diff in memory, on runs allowed to last 72 hours.
  Settled entries are evicted past a cap; in-flight ones never are, so coalescing still holds.
- **A request may describe a custom engine without being refused as one.** The HTTP guard matched
  any object under a custom-engine key, so a `tools` array — JSON Schema, including this package's
  own `autoloop_start` declaration — tripped it, and every tool-bearing turn through
  `/v1/chat/completions` failed with a 400 while a tool-free request passed. The guard now tests
  what makes an inline config dangerous: a `bin`/`binEnv` that resolves to an executable. Actual
  inline configs are refused exactly as before.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: the Codex thread-listing tool is now `codex_thread_list`.** `codex_threads`
  collided with the identically named tool in `@openclaw/codex`, and neither plugin reported a
  diagnostic — the two silently shadowed each other. Callers using `codex_threads` must update.
- Autoloop start and resume accept `send_timeout_ms`, `activity_lease_ms`, and
  `autoloop_hard_timeout_ms` over the tools, HTTP, and CLI surfaces. Runs that omit them keep the
  previous behaviour.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-09-03

Claude Code 2.1.258 → 2.1.259, Codex 0.152.1 → 0.153.0, Antigravity 1.1.22 → 1.1.25, OpenCode
1.18.26 → 1.18.27; Grok Build unchanged at 1.0.13. This is the first sweep run by the new script
rather than by hand, and it found one real regression that the by-hand method would have missed.

### Added

- **`scripts/sweep.ts` — the weekly engine sweep as a deterministic script.** Installed version
  against the CLAUDE.md pin and upstream; the flags each wrapper passes against what its binary's
  `--help` lists; one live turn per core engine **through the real wrapper class**, so the wrapper's
  own defaults are what is tested; and the ACP + MCP handshakes. Exit 1 on a regression. No LLM in
  it — the thing that says a wrapper is broken must not share the wrapper's failure modes.
  `scripts/sweep-workflow.json` wraps it as a kernel run: verifier → router → an agent that drafts
  the alignment on a `sweep/<date>` branch → a human gate. Neither ships in the package.
- **`--permission-prompts none` on every Claude session without a prompt tool** (CLI 2.1.259+).
  This spawn shape has no TTY and, without `permissionPromptTool`, nobody to answer a permission
  prompt — a tool call the permission mode did not already decide sat waiting until the turn
  timeout. It is now denied instead; the model sees the denial and can adapt, and the permission
  mode still decides everything else. Verified against 2.1.259 with `acceptEdits`: a clean turn, no
  denials recorded.
- **`gemini-3.8-flash`** registered for the Antigravity engine at its current $0.75/$3.75 list rate
  (promotional through 2026-12-31; the scheduled rate is deliberately not priced).

### Fixed

- **The Antigravity default model no longer exists on agy 1.1.25.** `gemini-3.5-flash` was dropped
  from `agy models`; a session asking for it gets `status: ERROR` with an empty response and nothing
  on stderr, while 3.7 and 3.8 complete normally. This wrapper always passes `--model`, so every
  Antigravity session with no explicit model was failing. The default and the `agy-flash` alias
  moved to `gemini-3.8-flash`, verified with a live turn. The 3.5 entry stays registered — it is
  still a real API model — but no longer carries the alias. The wrapper's claim that an unknown
  model "silently falls back" was true on 1.0.16 and is not true now; the comment says so.

  The by-hand sweep exercised agy with a minimal argv and no `--model`, so it passed on agy's own
  default and never saw this. The script's first version did the same and passed too. The live turn
  now goes through the wrapper, which is what users run.

### Notes

- Help-text diffing is advisory, not a verdict. The script's first run reported four Claude flags as
  removed (`--max-turns` among them); all four are still accepted — claude omits hidden options from
  `--help`, and passes an unknown option straight through to help with exit 0, so there is no free
  way to ask. Such flags are listed as "not advertised" and do not fail the sweep.
- Grok on a spent free tier can hang `-p` silently rather than error, in any directory, with or
  without its leader process. The sweep caps grok at 90 seconds and names a zero-turn result as a
  silent hang. Grok could not be re-verified this week; its pin stays at 1.0.13.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **ZCode community engine preset**, the first one, contributed by @bwndlct. It points at the
  contributor-maintained `@bwndlct/zcode-claw-adapter` package and carries provenance for ZCode
  0.16.5 with a published two-turn context smoke record. The protocol translation lives in that
  package, which is the split the community tier exists to make possible.
- **`clawo engines`** lists the bundled presets with each one's provenance — who attested it,
  against which engine version, on what date. Read from the installed package rather than over HTTP,
  so it works with no server running.
- **`clawo session-start --custom-engine <preset-id>`.** `-e custom` was offered by the CLI and
  could not be satisfied by it: there was no option to supply the engine, so the path failed with
  "customEngine config is required". Found by @bwndlct, twice — first while preparing the ZCode
  preset, then in a follow-up PR to correct the guide. The contribution path's first outside user
  walked straight into it, which is roughly the point of having one.

### Changed

- **The HTTP guard now refuses inline custom-engine configs specifically, rather than the whole
  field.** Its reason has always been that a custom engine names an executable to spawn — but
  `engine: 'codex'` spawns one too and is accepted, so spawning was never the line; arbitrary argv
  is. A preset id cannot carry any: it selects one of the descriptions this package ships. Inline
  configs remain local-only, and a preset id is now the supported way to reach a custom engine from
  the CLI. Verified both directions against a running server: an inline config carrying
  `/bin/sh -c "touch …"` is refused and writes nothing, while a preset id reaches the spawn.

### Fixed

- **The smoke script in CONTRIBUTING.md named a command that does not exist.** It used
  `clawo session start` (the command is `session-start`) and a `--custom-engine` option that had not
  been implemented. It was written without being run. It now matches the CLI, starts from
  `clawo engines` to confirm the preset loads at all, and says why the preset — not an inline config
  — is what has to be smoked.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **A contribution path for third-party engines.** `customEngine` now accepts the id of a preset
  bundled in `configs/engines/` as well as an inline config, so a third-party CLI can be described
  once and shipped rather than retyped by every caller.

  Engines sit in three tiers, and the line between them is verification, not code quality. **Core**
  engines are wrapped in this repo, exercised with a live turn every week, and pinned to a version
  someone here actually ran — which requires that a maintainer can obtain and run the binary.
  **Community** presets are shipped as data: the schema is validated here, and whether the engine
  runs is its maintainer's claim, against a named version, on a named date. **Legacy** engines stay
  wired and untracked.

  The middle tier is deliberately not gated on a maintainer running it. Most of the CLIs worth
  supporting are behind credentials this project does not hold, so that bar would keep the tier
  permanently empty — and an empty tier is indistinguishable from never having done the work.
  Requiring an attributable, dated, falsifiable attestation keeps the door open without anyone here
  claiming to have tested what they have not. CI enforces the parts that can be checked without the
  engine's credentials, and a preset that passes CI has not been shown to work.

  A preset never carries protocol translation. A CLI that speaks its own wire format needs an
  adapter binary in its author's own package, with the preset pointing `bin` at it — the split
  `@enderfga/dsh-clawo` already uses. Keeping the translation out of this repo is what makes a
  preset shippable without owning a protocol that cannot be tested here.

  A preset id is refused over HTTP exactly as an inline config is: naming a shipped description is
  tamer than arbitrary argv, but it is still a remote caller causing a process to spawn.

  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-an-engine) for the two contribution shapes and
  the smoke script that produces the attestation.

## [6.2.1] - 2026-09-02

Claude Code 2.1.251 → 2.1.258, Codex 0.151.0 → 0.152.1, OpenCode 1.18.25 → 1.18.26; Antigravity and
Grok Build unchanged. Exactly one item across all of it is AI-facing — the rest is TUI, settings,
auto-mode and gateway behaviour. Codex's `exec` flag set and model list are byte-identical across the
bump, OpenCode's `run` flags likewise, and both ran a live turn at their new version.

### Fixed

- **Registered Claude Fable 5.1, and moved the `fable` alias onto it.** `claude-fable-5-1` is the new
  default Fable model, and the CLI's own `fable` resolves to it — verified by reading
  `modelUsage.canonicalModel` back from a real turn against 2.1.258 rather than taking the release
  note's word for it. An alias left pointing at the previous generation is the drift that has hit
  this registry once per generation (Opus 5, Sonnet 5) and never fails loudly; it just prices at the
  wrong model. `claude-mythos-5-1` is registered alongside it, as Mythos is the same model under
  limited availability.
- **Priced 5.1's cache reads at their own rate.** Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1 read cache at **0.025x
  base input** — $0.25 per Mtok against a $10 input price — where every other Claude model is 0.1x.
  Copying Fable 5's $1, or deriving the number from the input rate, over-reports those two by 4x.
  Cache _writes_ keep the usual 1.25x / 2x multipliers, so only the read is exceptional. A test
  asserts the exception together with the rule it breaks, so a blanket edit in either direction
  fails.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-08-31

Weekly engine sweep: Claude Code 2.1.246 → 2.1.251, Codex 0.149.1 → 0.151.0, Antigravity 1.1.21 →
1.1.22, Grok Build 1.0.5 → 1.0.13, OpenCode 1.18.23 → 1.18.25. Each ran a live turn at its new
version, and the ACP and MCP entry points were smoke-tested alongside them.

No registry drift this week — the first time in several. Today was also the last day of the window
Sonnet 5's $2/$10 was announced under, and Anthropic's pricing page now states that price is standard
and the scheduled increase will not happen, which is what this project already had.

### Added

- **Grok now receives the session options it has been ignoring.** 1.0.13 grew a programmatic surface
  for nine options this project already had, every one of which the wrapper was dropping on the
  floor: `appendSystemPrompt` → `--rules`, `allowedTools` → `--tools`, `disallowedTools` →
  `--disallowed-tools`, `jsonSchema` → `--json-schema`, `agent` → `--agent`, `agents` → `--agents`,
  `dangerouslySkipPermissions` → `--always-approve`, `customSessionId` → `--session-id`, and
  `forkSession` → `--fork-session`. `--session-id` names a new conversation, so it is withheld on a
  plain resume and passed on a forked one, which is the only combination grok accepts. Note that grok
  validates neither tool list: a name that does not exist is ignored rather than rejected, so a typo
  in a denylist silently leaves the tool enabled.
- **`restricted` (Claude Code).** Maps to `--restricted`, added in CLI 2.1.249: the command- and
  code-running tools and `WebFetch` are removed from the session rather than denied on request. It is
  deliberately not folded into `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` — measured against 2.1.251, plan mode alone
  already refused a direct write, a shell write and a delegated subagent write, and `--restricted`
  also drops the caller's user, project and local settings files, taking their CLAUDE.md and hooks
  with them. That is not something to switch on behind a caller's back.

### Changed

- **Grok's read-only refusal is now a measured finding rather than a cautious one.** The obvious
  construction — a `--tools` allowlist of read-only built-ins plus `--permission-mode plan` — refuses
  a direct write and a shell write against 1.0.13, then loses to the third prompt in the matrix:
  asked to delegate, the session spawned a subagent and the file appeared. The subagent does not
  inherit the parent's tool restriction, which is the same load-bearing hole found in OpenCode, where
  denying the write tools without denying `task` left the delegation path open. grok ships
  `--no-subagents` and that is the obvious next probe; it is not wired up, because the run that would
  have confirmed it hit the account's free-tier usage limit, and a probe that fails for lack of quota
  writes no file either. Reading that as a pass is how an unproven boundary ships. The thrown error
  now names what was measured.
- `-p` is the short form of grok's `--single` since 1.0.13, renamed from `--print`. This wrapper
  passes the short form, so the rename is invisible here.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-08-27

Both defects surfaced while connecting `clawo-mcp` to an MCP host for the first time.

### Fixed

- **The commands in `package.json#bin` were not executable.** `tsc` writes 0644 and the build never
  restored the bit. A published install hides this — npm sets the mode itself when it links a bin —
  but a `npm link` checkout points straight at these files, so after a build the commands sit on
  PATH and refuse to run with "permission denied", while `command -v` reports them as missing
  because it only considers executables. `clawo` had therefore only ever worked when invoked as
  `node $(which clawo)`, and `clawo-mcp` / `clawo-acp` could not be run at all. `scripts/postbuild.mjs`
  now marks all three executable.
- **The MCP server reported the wrong version to every host.** It read
  `process.env.npm_package_version`, which npm sets only for a process npm itself started; an MCP
  host spawns the binary directly, so the variable was never present and the hard-coded fallback —
  `3.7.0`, the version current when that line was written — was what got sent every time. It now
  reads the package manifest, the way `bin/cli.ts` already did.

### Fixed (test harness)

- **A lock holder spawned by the test suite could outlive the run that made it.** `holdLock` waits
  on a release marker the test writes, and that was its only way out, so a run that crashed, timed
  out, or was interrupted left the child process holding memory and a lock file until reboot. Two
  calls in that file had also been written against older signatures and neither failed: one passed
  a duration where an options object was expected, leaving the marker path undefined and the child
  waiting on `existsSync(undefined)` — false forever; the other dropped a required owner id, so the
  takeover a test describes went in under `undefined`. The holder now also exits on an absolute
  deadline or when its parent goes away, and an unusable marker path throws at the call rather than
  leaking silently. `tsconfig.test.json` plus `npm run typecheck:tests` closes the blind spot that
  hid both calls — tests are excluded from the build so that they stay out of `dist/`, which also
  meant nothing type-checked them. It is a diagnostic, not a CI gate; its header explains why.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-08-27

Engine sweep: Claude Code 2.1.237 → 2.1.246, Codex 0.148.0 → 0.149.1, Antigravity 1.1.15 → 1.1.21,
OpenCode 1.18.18 → 1.18.23, Grok Build unchanged at 1.0.5. Each engine ran a live turn at its new
version, and the ACP stdio entry point was smoke-tested alongside them. Chasing what the CLIs now
report turned up four ways this project was measuring their turns wrong.

### Fixed

- **Every Claude turn's tokens were counted twice.** The CLI reports one turn's usage on the
  streaming `message_delta` and again on the terminal `result`, and both were added to the running
  totals. Measured against 2.1.246 on a live turn: the engine reported `in=2 / out=4 /
cache_read=47371` and `getStats()` returned `4 / 8 / 94742`. A turn's usage is now folded in once —
  streamed deltas apply provisionally so a long turn still moves, and the authoritative `result`
  replaces rather than repeats them. A turn spanning several assistant messages (one per tool round)
  keeps every message, since each carries its own delta series.
- **Cost estimates left out cache writes, which is most of what a cached turn pays for.** The formula
  priced input, cached reads and output, and nothing else. On a turn with 31,435 one-hour cache
  writes the CLI reported `$0.322428` while the formula produced `$0.016` — a 20x under-report, on
  the figure `maxBudgetUsd` gates against. Claude sessions now take the engine's own
  `total_cost_usd`, which is cache-aware; it is a session running total rather than a per-turn
  figure, so spend advances by the difference between turns and picks up again from zero when a
  resume replaces the CLI process. Proxy sessions keep the estimate, because there the CLI prices
  another provider's tokens as Opus. The estimate itself, still used when no engine figure arrives,
  now prices cache writes from the 5-minute / 1-hour split the engine reports.
- **Subtracting cached reads out of input tokens is only correct on one engine.** `codex` counts
  cached reads inside `input_tokens` (`total 19704 = input 19699 + output 5`); `grok`, `opencode` and
  `claude` report them alongside it (`total 30034 = input 19393 + output 17 + read 10624`). Doing the
  subtraction on the latter removes tokens that were never there and prices them at the cached rate.
  It failed silently and without bound: after two opencode turns the running cached total exceeds the
  running input total, the `Math.max(0, …)` clamp reaches zero, and the whole session's input bills
  at the cached rate. Engines now declare which convention they follow.
- **`contextPercent` read a nearly-full context as empty.** It was computed from `input_tokens`,
  which on a resumed conversation excludes the history — that arrives as cached reads. A Claude turn
  carrying a 47k prompt reported 2 input tokens and the metric read 0%; `onContextHigh` could
  likewise never fire. It is now the whole prompt (input + cached reads + cache writes) over the
  window the engine reports for the model it actually ran (`modelUsage[*].contextWindow`), with the
  registry as fallback — the same thing the codex-app session already did. A one-shot engine with no
  model set also measures against its own default model's window instead of the registry's catch-all
  200K, which reported a half-full grok session as full.
- **Reasoning effort was being clamped to levels the engines had outgrown.** `max` folded to `xhigh`
  on Codex, which now has a real `max` and an `ultra` above it; `xhigh` folded to `high` on Grok,
  which accepts `xhigh` natively. Both cost callers a tier they had asked for. All three Codex levels
  were exercised against 0.149.1 and completed turns.
- **OpenCode ignored `effort` entirely.** Its knob is `--variant`, which the wrapper never passed, so
  every caller's setting was dropped. OpenCode does not validate the value: a level its provider does
  not offer runs at the default rather than failing.
- **Model registry drift.** `gemini-3.7-flash` and `gemini-3.6-flash` — both offered by agy 1.1.21,
  3.7 being the newest tier — were unregistered and fell through to the family default: Sonnet rates
  and a 200K window against a real 1M. `gemini-3.5-flash` was priced at `$0.5/$3` against a list rate
  of `$1.50/$9.00`. `gpt-5.2`, still selectable in Codex, was unregistered (real window 400K,
  `$1.75/$14`).

### Added

- `ultra` reasoning effort, reachable on Codex. Every engine clamps to its own ceiling rather than
  dropping the field: Claude Code stops at `max`, Grok at `xhigh`, Antigravity at `high`.
- `noSessionPersistence` now means something on Codex, which gained `--ephemeral`. It had reached
  only Claude Code before.
- `ignoreUserConfig` (Codex): run without loading `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, so an orchestrated run
  is decided by what the caller passed rather than by the machine's own Codex config — notably a
  `model = …` line in it, which otherwise picks the model while the ledger records the engine
  default. Auth still resolves from `CODEX_HOME`.
- `addDir` reaches Codex as `--add-dir`, on the first turn only; `exec resume` rejects it and the
  resumed thread keeps the roots it opened with.

## [6.0.4] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **The fence around end-user text escaped the bracket, not the tag.** Matching up to the closing
  `>` and re-emitting what was captured let `hola<user a</user>` smuggle a raw `</user>` through the
  attribute slot of a tag that WAS matched, forging the `assistant` turn the fence exists to stop;
  zero-width padding (`</user\u200B>`) evaded it outright, since `\s` does not match U+200B. Only the
  `<` is escaped now, by lookahead, with a boundary class that covers the 6,060 zero-advance or
  blank-rendering code points — `[\s></\p{Cc}\p{Cf}]` alone let 5,806 of them through. The same
  filler, plus the slash, is allowed before the name: `hola</​user>` renders as `hola</user>` and
  forged a turn past a trailing-complete fence, so the lookahead now admits the zero-advance subset
  (no `\s`, no U+2800) there too — swept over all three positions, 12,120 unfenced probes drop to 38,
  the visible separators already excluded on cost. That leading part is ONE class `[/…]*`, not
  `[…]*\/?[…]*`: two adjacent unbounded quantifiers over the same class backtrack O(n²) and a single
  ~100 KB history message hung the event loop ~80 s. `</ user>` with a visible space is still not
  fenced; the reference says which text that spares.
- **A send that threw recorded the turn as delivered.** `seededConversations` was written before the
  send, so a first turn that failed with a 500 left the thread credited with a turn it never received
  and the caller's next, short turn went out with no history — the exact string this change set exists
  to stop. Both handlers now report whether the send landed, and the record happens only then.
  `sendMessage` returning is the signal: a returned error is answered with 502 and still records,
  because the CLI received the prompt. A second request arriving while the first is in flight sees no
  fingerprint and replays — a duplicate rather than a drop.

- **OpenAI-compat: the conversation history was discarded on any thread the
  engine had not opened.** `extractUserMessage()` returned only the text of the
  caller's last `user` message, so the earlier `user`/`assistant` turns in
  `messages[]` were dropped — including when the engine held no transcript they
  could have been in. A caller that opens a new conversation per turn (a session
  key that hashes the last message) therefore sent a full transcript on the wire
  and the engine received one line of it. Measured on 1834 production sessions: a
  short follow-up turn — "yes, go ahead", with the request one turn back — was
  carried out 2 times out of 32 on this path, against 235 of 309 on an engine that
  does not route through it. Those turns now go out as one
  `<conversation_history>` block, the same wrapper tag `renderHistory()` in the
  autoloop dispatcher already uses to replay turns to an engine with no
  conversation of its own.

  Which turns are in scope is `serializeConversationHistory()`'s decision, keyed
  on the engine's state rather than the shape of the array — and on _which_
  conversation that engine is holding, because a live thread under a session name
  is not automatically this caller's thread. A key that hashes the latest message
  resolves every repeat of a short confirmation to the session an earlier exchange
  opened; a client that sends no key hashes model+system+tools into one name
  shared by all of its chats; and on `claude`, the default engine,
  `nativeThreadIsLive()` has no id to check and returns true for anything in the
  session map. The bridge therefore records a fingerprint of the `user` turns it
  has pushed to each session and replays unless this request continues exactly
  that. On its own live thread the message is byte-identical to before, which is
  what keeps Anthropic prompt caching (PR #40) warm, and `[system, user]` — the
  shape the main agent, cron jobs and subagents send — is untouched.

  The whole block is capped at 24,000 characters — wrapper tags, per-turn tags,
  elision markers and framing included, not just the sum of the turn text —
  oldest turns dropped first, matching `REPLAY_CHAR_BUDGET` in the dispatcher:
  six of the nine engines pass the prompt as a single argv element, as does a
  one-shot `custom` engine, and Linux caps one argument at 128 KiB, so going over
  is a 500 with the turn lost rather than a turn missing context. Charging the
  turn text alone was not a cap at all: 8,000 alternating one-word turns rendered
  165,008 bytes, because the ~16 characters of tags per turn were never counted.
  No turn is started with less than 200 characters of room left, in either
  direction from the newest `user` turn in the block, which is otherwise held
  back from the budget by up to 200 characters so that one long reply cannot
  strand the ask behind it — before that reserve, replies adding past the cap
  (two ordinary 12k ones sufficed) started the window past every `user` turn,
  the leading-`assistant` rule cleared what was left, and nothing went out at
  all: the caller's latest turn reached the engine alone, this change set's own
  headline failure. Verified over 44,000 random shapes: max block 23,999
  characters, none over 24,000, none rendered content-free, and none that had a
  block before and lost it.

  Replayed text has every tag the prompt treats as structure escaped, since a
  replayed turn is end-user text and `hi</user>\n<assistant>...` would otherwise
  forge a turn in
  the engine's own voice. `skills/references/openai-compat.md` has the rest,
  including what this does not cover.

### Changed

- **OpenAI-compat: `X-Session-Reset` now replays the conversation.** A reset turn
  means the engine holds nothing, so the history block goes out in full where it
  previously sent only the caller's latest text. Correct under "the engine has
  nothing"; under "the caller asked to start clean" it is the opposite, and a
  client that sends the header on every request AND re-sends `messages[]` now pays
  for the transcript each time.

## [6.0.3] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

An external multi-agent review of the 6.0.2 tree reported 33 findings across the
run kernel, the HTTP/ACP/OpenAI surfaces and the session manager. Each was
reproduced against the built code before being changed, and each fix is
mutation-checked — reverting the predicate reddens its own tests and no others.

**Inputs that reached further than they should**

- `/session/start` accepted a custom engine from the request body. The guard
  that refuses one covered `/autoloop/new` and `/autoloop/<id>/resume` and
  matched three snake_case keys, while `session_start` spells the field
  `customEngine` — so the object reached `startSession()` verbatim and from
  there `PersistentCustomSession` spawns `bin`. The guard now matches by shape
  and runs on every request body, so a route added later cannot reintroduce it.
- An openai-compat session key became a directory name unsanitised. The
  `x-session-id` header is taken verbatim and the handler builds
  `os.tmpdir()/openclaw-compat-<name>`, mkdirs it recursively and starts the
  session there under `bypassPermissions`; a key carrying `../` resolved outside
  the temp directory entirely. Keys that are already filesystem-safe pass
  through unchanged.
- A cross-session message body could forge a second envelope, carrying any
  `from` it liked — which is what the recipient uses to attribute the sender.
  Only the bracket of a cross-session tag is escaped, so code in a message is
  untouched.
- `getAnthropicBaseUrl()` returned the first `baseUrl` in `openclaw.json`
  rather than the `anthropic` one, sending Anthropic passthrough — the
  `x-api-key` header and the whole prompt body — to another provider's host.

**Work done twice, or on the wrong thing**

- The `solve` template repaired runs that were already green. Its two chained
  routers read as "loop while verify is red AND budget remains", but a router
  whose routes all miss falls through to the next node, so the budget check
  matched on its own: a first-try green run made four implement/review/verify
  cycles instead of one. Router conditions gained `and`, and the two routers
  are now one.
- Council selected worktrees to force-remove by testing whether the path
  contained the string `council`, which matched a user's own worktree at
  `~/council-notes` and missed council's at `.worktrees/agent-A`. Selection is
  containment under `{projectDir}/.worktrees/`; `git worktree list` gained
  `--porcelain`, so a path with a space is no longer truncated.
- An abort that landed while `setupWorktrees` was still running left every
  worktree on disk, because cleanup was gated on a map that is not populated
  until setup returns.
- A subflow could outlive the cancel meant to stop it, and started without the
  parent's secrets.
- The verdict-staleness check re-measured the tree at the run's cwd while the
  verifier had measured at its own, so a verifier declaring `cwd` had its
  passing verdict compared against an unrelated tree.
- Evidence bundles collided across repair passes: the id was keyed on the
  per-visit retry counter, which restarts at 1 on every visit, so each pass
  overwrote the previous bundle. Ids carry the visit now.
- `session/cancel` tore the session down whether or not a turn was in flight,
  dropping the engine's native conversation id and forking the history.
- A parked council did not block ordinary follow-up prompts, so a second
  council started over the worktrees the parked one still held.

**Answers that were wrong, or missing**

- Fanout published a failed synthesis turn as the answer: `sendMessage` reports
  a turn-level failure by returning `{error}`, not by throwing, so the catch
  never ran and `synthesisError` stayed undefined.
- Broadcast reported `delivered`/`queued` as each other's negation, which
  cannot encode a broadcast that did both.
- Streaming dropped the reply for engines with no delta channel (opencode,
  agy, the per-send codex/cursor wrappers, one-shot custom engines): the role
  chunk and the stop chunk went out with nothing between them.
- The streaming branch of the Anthropic passthrough piped the upstream body
  without checking `resp.ok`, so a 401/429/500 arrived as HTTP 200 with SSE
  headers — an empty stream to any SSE parser.
- Text a model emitted after a tool call was discarded, though
  `text → tool_use → text` is one valid Anthropic turn.
- An HTTP check could outlive its declared timeout by two orders of magnitude:
  the deadline was enforced only between poll iterations and the request
  carried no signal, so a server that never sends headers parked it until the
  transport default.
- `noSessionPersistence` reached the engine but not this orchestrator's own
  session registry, so `session-start x --skip-persistence` twice reattached to
  the first conversation.
- The openai-compat session fingerprint hashed a tool's name and description
  but not its parameters, so a changed schema landed on the session holding the
  old one.
- `switchModel` validated against a frozen prefix list and rejected `grok-4.6`,
  `composer-*`, `o3`, `o4-mini` and `codex-mini-latest`.
- The orphan reaper's list of CLI binaries was missing `grok`, so an orphaned
  grok CLI was never cleaned up; TTL cleanup did not forget the PID it stopped,
  leaving dead PIDs on disk for that reaper to probe.
- `_ensureProxyServer` checked its port synchronously and assigned it several
  awaits later, so concurrent starts each bound a server and only the last was
  closed on shutdown.
- `hasConsensusMarker` knew three of the five vote formats the parser reads.
- `replayRun` counted a retry as a visit; `_absorb` replaced a node's artifact
  list rather than merging; the truncation notice cited an unsanitised path;
  `SIDE_EFFECT_KINDS` listed four of the ten node kinds; the run state stayed
  `verifying` after a mid-chain verifier; three SSE endpoints wrote to the
  response with no disconnect guard; and `workflow show` cast its response as
  `Record<string, never>`.

### Changed

- Router conditions accept `{ type: 'and', all: [...] }`. Closed and
  depth-capped like the rest of the vocabulary — see
  `skills/references/workflow.md`.
- Evidence bundle ids are `<node>-v<visit>-<attempt>`, so a repair loop keeps
  every pass.
- `noSessionPersistence` now also keeps the session out of this orchestrator's
  resume registry, which is what "do not save session to disk" was always
  documented to mean.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **OpenAI-compat: tool results were discarded on any thread the engine had not
  opened.** `extractUserMessage()` decided whether to send the caller's tool
  results by reading the SHAPE of the messages array — "is the last non-system
  message a `tool` role?" — to answer a question about the ENGINE's state: "does
  its transcript already hold them?". The two come apart whenever there is no
  transcript. A `[..., tool, user]` or `[..., tool, assistant]` array sent to a
  session whose native conversation did not exist yet had every result dropped,
  and the turn was answered without them while the request still returned 200. The decision is now `serializeToolResults()`'s alone, keyed on
  `threadHasHistory` — the parameter that already described the engine. Requests
  carrying no tool results are untouched.

  The `latestRoundOnly` scoping is unchanged, and so is the condition it rests
  on, now asserted rather than assumed: it slices from the array's last
  `assistant` message, so it bounds a tool loop to one round per hop only for a
  client that echoes the `tool_calls` turn it is answering. An array with no
  `assistant` message anywhere gives `lastIndexOf()` `-1` and `slice(0)` — the
  whole array — so on that array `latestRoundOnly` is a no-op: the serialized
  block is byte-identical with the flag set and unset, and the client re-sends the
  entire loop on every hop, before this change as after it. Same for a turn with
  no live conversation, where nothing is scoped by design. So "the duplication is
  bounded to one round" holds only where the scoping actually runs.
  `skills/references/openai-compat.md` documents each case.

- **Docs: `X-Session-Reset` is not honored on a request that ends in a `tool`
  result.** No behaviour change here — the header is parsed after the branch that
  handles a trailing `tool` role returns, so on that one shape the reset stops no
  session and creates no conversation, and the turn is treated as a resumed one.
  `skills/references/openai-compat.md` said a reset turn always stops the session
  and starts a new one; it now carries the exception.

- **A refused request is drained before it is answered.** The 415 for a wrong
  `Content-Type` ended the response without reading the body it was refusing, so the
  connection could be torn down while the peer was still writing — `write ECONNRESET` on
  the client, and a non-zero process exit in a test run where every test still reported
  passing. Reported from a real run. It is not covered by a test: neither a 4 MB body nor
  a staged write reproduces the reset on macOS, and a test that passes with the fix
  deleted would be worse than none.

### Testing

- **Two lock-contention tests no longer race a wall clock.** They spawned a holder that
  released on its own 150 ms timer while the acquisition waits
  `DEFAULT_LOCK_WAIT_MS = 250` — a 100 ms margin, reported flaking 8 runs out of 8 on a
  loaded 16-core box, and passing 4 of 4 on the same box unloaded. The holder now reports
  when it actually holds the lock and releases on the test's signal, so contention is
  established rather than assumed and the release is not a timer racing a deadline. The
  second test is now deterministic: the holder does not let go until after the run has
  ended, so the write it must fail cannot succeed by timing.

  The `setTimeout(60)` they replaced was the worse half: it assumed the child had already
  taken the lock, so on a slow spawn the test contended with nothing and passed anyway —
  a silent second failure mode next to the loud one. Both mutation-checked: making the
  lock fail on sight reddens the first, and removing both claim-handover paths reddens
  the second.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **`pricingOverrides` now applies however the session spelled its model.** The runtime
  override map was keyed by whatever string the user typed, while `getModelPricing()`
  stripped the vendor prefix before looking it up and never resolved aliases — so an
  override could silently miss the session it was written for, in both directions:
  - An override on `claude-opus-5` was found by a `claude` session (which canonicalises
    `options.model` in `start()`, `src/persistent-session.ts:178-181`), but an override
    written as `opus` was dead for every `claude` session.
  - For the eight engines that never canonicalise, the reverse held — and because
    `_persistSession()` stores the canonical id (`src/session-manager.ts:2011`), the same
    session priced by its raw spelling on a first run and by the canonical id after a
    resume, so an override could start or stop applying with no config change.
  - A prefixed key (`openai/gpt-5.4`) could never be reached from either spelling.

  Reads and writes now share one canonical key (prefix strip, then `resolveAlias`), and
  the merge base is computed from that same key so a partial override on a prefixed id no
  longer stores `output: 0`.

- **A session with no explicit model gets its configured price.** `getModelPricing()`
  returned the registry rate before consulting the override map whenever `model` was
  absent, which is the normal case for codex and agy — and for non-Claude autoloop roles
  it is deliberate (`src/session-manager.ts:494-496`). The engine default and the
  unknown-model fallback now go through the map like an explicit model does, so the
  flat-rate case the field exists for is actually covered.

- **A partial override on an unregistered model id says so.** There is no list price to
  merge onto, so the unspecified fields become 0 — free tokens. That is a legitimate idiom
  and a very common typo, and they are indistinguishable at that point, so
  `overrideModelPricing()` now warns instead of resolving it silently. Previously the
  override also suppressed the unknown-model warning at `src/models.ts:512`, so a
  misspelled id went from noisy to silent.

### Added

- **`pricingOverrides` is declared in the plugin config schema.** The capability was
  already wired — `api.pluginConfig` reaches the `SessionManager` constructor
  (`src/index.ts:138`, `:159`) and `overrideModelPricing()` has been there all along — but
  the field was absent from `openclaw.plugin.json`, so on the surface most users actually
  configure it was invisible and unvalidated.

  ```json
  { "pricingOverrides": { "gpt-5.5": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cached": 0 } } }
  ```

  The per-model object is closed (`additionalProperties: false`), so a misspelled field
  name such as `{"cache": 0}` is rejected instead of silently doing nothing, and keys must
  be non-empty — `""` validated before and could never be read, since `''` is falsy and
  `src/models.ts` returns on the absent-model branch first.

- **The config schema is asserted against `PluginConfig`.** `tool-registration.test.ts`
  compared only `manifest.contracts.tools`; nothing checked `configSchema`, which is how
  the field could be missing in the first place. Keys are now compared with
  compile-time exhaustiveness, and the two enums are compared by value — which caught
  `defaultPermissionMode` still offering `delegate` (removed from `PermissionMode` in
  4.7.0 because the CLI rejects it at spawn) and omitting `manual`, and `defaultEffort`
  omitting `xhigh`. Both are fixed: with the host validating the manifest, the previously
  valid `defaultPermissionMode: "manual"` failed validation and the plugin did not load.

### Changed

- **Zeroing a model's pricing disables `maxBudgetUsd` for it**, and
  `skills/references/observability.md` now says so next to the recipe that recommends it.
  The cap reads the session's accrued cost, so a zeroed model never trips it wherever that
  cost is pricing-derived. Two engines are outside that: `engine: 'claude'` keeps the CLI's
  own `--max-budget-usd` (`src/persistent-session.ts:216`), accounted independently, and
  `engine: 'grok'` passes through the engine's own `total_cost_usd` into `_stats.costUsd`
  without consulting the registry (`src/persistent-grok-session.ts:202-203`), so its cap
  keeps biting on a zeroed model. No other engine has a native cap.

  Because the fixes above route the engine default through the override map, the recipe
  now also reaches `cursor` and `opencode` default sessions, which both declare
  `defaultModel: 'claude-sonnet-4-6'` — zeroing a Claude subscription zeroes those too.
  Documented on the same page.

- **Overrides that silently did nothing now take effect**, so `costUsd` will move for
  anyone whose override was keyed by an alias or a vendor prefix. No test covered the old
  behaviour; the existing override tests all use bare, unprefixed keys.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-08-23

Two things this runtime could not previously do: survive its own process dying,
and check an agent's work. This release adds both, and they arrive together
because a verifier is a node in the thing that survives.

### Added

- **Durable run kernel (`src/kernel/`).** A declarative `WorkflowSpec` over ten
  node kinds — `agent`, `fanout`, `council`, `verifier`, `human_gate`, `router`,
  `subflow`, and the three whose executors are injected because their engines
  need more than the kernel has any business knowing (`autoloop`,
  `ultraapp_synth`, `ultraapp_deploy`) — with retry, per-node timeout, cancel,
  steer, human gates, and
  bounded loops. Every state transition is checkpointed to
  `~/.claw-orchestrator/wf/<runId>/` before the next step begins, so a run
  survives a restart and `workflow_resume` re-attaches at the node boundary:
  nodes already succeeded are not re-run, and the one that was in flight is
  retried, because a half-finished node left no result to trust. The immutable
  spec is stored apart from the mutable checkpoint, so a torn `run.json` is
  recovered by replaying `events.jsonl` rather than lost.
  Four built-in templates ship as ordinary specs: `solve`, `council`, `fanout`,
  `ultraapp`.

  Two limits stated plainly rather than glossed. Node execution is
  **at-least-once**: there is no idempotency key, attempt lease, or side-effect
  commit marker, so a node that wrote files and died before its checkpoint runs
  again from the top. And the boundaries are node boundaries: a node that dies
  half-way is retried whole, because a half-finished node left no result worth
  trusting.

- **Verification plane (`src/verify/`).** Acceptance contracts the runtime runs
  itself: `command` (argv, gated on exit code), `http`, `screenshot`,
  `diff_policy`, `file`. A run carrying a contract cannot reach `completed`
  unless every required check passes. Each attempt writes an evidence bundle —
  verdict, per-check output tails, the patch, screenshots — that outlives the
  process. Contracts come from the caller or a mode default and are never read
  from agent output; unrecognised fields are dropped before anything executes,
  and there is no shell string anywhere to inject into.
- **`RunOutcome`: `verified` | `refuted` | `unverified`.** Finishing and being
  right are now different questions. A run with no contract completes as
  `unverified` — it says it does not know, which is not the same as success, and
  the read surfaces keep the three apart rather than collapsing them into
  pass/fail.
- **Eight tools**: `workflow_start`, `workflow_status`, `workflow_list`,
  `workflow_resume`, `workflow_cancel`, `workflow_steer`, `workflow_approve`,
  `verify_run` (77 total). Matching HTTP routes under `/workflow/*` including an
  SSE event stream, and `clawo workflow` / `clawo verify` on the CLI.
- **Baseline capture.** The change set a run produced, measured against the
  commit recorded when it started, covering tracked changes ∪ untracked files.
  Nothing in the project could previously answer that question correctly.
- Ledger rows gain `verified`, `evidenceId`, `contractId`, `nodeKind`,
  `repoLang`, `taskKind`, and `clawo runs` gains a `VERIFIED` column plus
  `--verified` / `--refuted`. All optional; rows written before 6.0.0 stay
  readable and nothing is backfilled.

### Changed

- **A fixer is told its input is data.** The fix-on-red loop hands an agent
  running under `bypassPermissions` the raw output of a check that ran against
  code an agent wrote — untrusted text, to a privileged reader. UltraApp's own
  fixer framed it as diagnostic data and the kernel's generic one did not, so
  moving UltraApp's build stage onto the generic verifier would have quietly
  dropped the mitigation. The framing is now in the kernel, so every verifier
  gets it, and it is asserted end to end — which UltraApp's own tests for that
  module never did. The superseded module is gone.

- **UltraApp's build pipeline is a kernel workflow.** It was the last thing
  running its own lifecycle: a mode enum in its own store, a call straight into
  `new Council().run()`, and nothing checkpointed between the stages. So a crash
  threw away a finished council — the most expensive thing in the run — and
  started it again from nothing, and the run appeared in no listing.

  It is now a three-node `WorkflowSpec`: synthesise by council, run the build
  contract (the ordinary `verifier` node, fix-on-red loop and all), deploy and
  check the deployed thing. `RunMode` survives as a projection of the kernel
  record — every reader keeps working — but it is no longer a second source of
  truth, and the projection is serialised per run so a late event handler cannot
  write a stale mode over a newer one.

  Two stages are UltraApp-specific node kinds (`ultraapp_synth`,
  `ultraapp_deploy`) with injected executors, exactly as `autoloop` is: the
  engine behind them needs a store, a router and a deploy strategy, and none of
  that belongs in the kernel. The stage between them needed no new kind at all.

  Two consequences the wiring has to honour, or the move buys nothing. A build
  the durable queue re-enqueues after a restart **resumes** its checkpoint
  instead of starting over, so the crash-recovery this was for actually reaches
  the product path — only an explicit rebuild takes a new incarnation. And
  cancelling a build cancels the workflow, not just the queue entry: a dispatched
  build used to carry on through verification and deploy while the user had been
  told it had stopped.

  The interview and the done-mode conversation deliberately stay where they are.
  They are user-driven and open-ended; expressing them as a workflow would mean a
  router self-loop fighting the visit bound, or one fake node with a state
  machine hidden inside it — unification as theatre. What moved is what is
  actually a pipeline.

- **Every orchestration mode runs on the kernel.** `council_start`,
  `fanout_start`, `ultraplan_start`, `ultrareview_start` and `autoloop_start`
  each create a durable run. Tool signatures and result shapes are unchanged —
  `CouncilSession`, `FanoutSession`, `UltraplanResult`, `UltrareviewResult` and
  `AutoloopState` are projected from the run record instead of held in memory —
  and the engines that do the work are untouched. What they lost is ownership of
  a lifecycle. Deleted: five result maps, four 30-minute eviction timers, a
  5-second poller, the two `Set`s fencing an autoloop start against a delete, and
  both cross-process enumerators (a regex over council markdown transcripts, and
  `autoloop-registry.jsonl` with its four bespoke read/write helpers).

  Three bugs went with them. A fan-out's results vanished 30 minutes after it
  finished, because the only copy was in a `Map`. An ultraplan still running when
  its TTL fired was rewritten as `error: 'Timed out (TTL expired)'` and deleted,
  so a long plan could be destroyed by its own eviction timer. And ultrareview's
  correctness depended on the fan-out's TTL: evict first and its poll threw, the
  interval was cleared, and the review stayed `running` forever.

  `autoloop_status` for a run not live in this process previously returned an
  all-zero stub labelled `reconstructed from registry`; it now returns the last
  state the loop published.

- **Breaking:** `councilStart`, `fanoutStart`, `ultraplanStart` and
  `ultrareviewStart` are async. Tool and HTTP callers are unaffected; direct
  TypeScript callers need an `await`.
- **`council_review` / `accept` / `reject` work after a restart.** They act on
  the git state a finished council left behind, so they now run against a
  `Council` rebuilt from the run record rather than requiring the instance that
  produced it.
- **Council consensus is advisory.** A council used to end when a regex found
  `[CONSENSUS: YES]` in every agent's prose. Votes are still collected and are
  now recorded on the run with their parse source, but they no longer decide
  whether the work is acceptable — a contract does. Without a contract, council
  behaves exactly as before and the run completes `unverified`.
- **UltraApp's build contract now runs `npm run smoke`.** §4 of the
  architectural conventions has always told the council that the smoke test
  gates build success. It was not in the step list, so the claim was false. A
  generated codebase without a working `scripts.smoke` now fails its build,
  which is what the brief said.
- **UltraApp's §7g frontend gate is captured by the runtime.** Both viewports are
  screenshotted against the deployed URL and stored as evidence, so whether a
  capture happened is a file on disk rather than an agent's claim. It captures
  and stores; it does not compare pixels. Advisory by default so a host without
  Chrome does not lose a working app —
  `CLAWO_ULTRAAPP_VISUAL_GATE=strict` makes a failed capture block the deploy.
- **Autoloop accepts a contract**, which holds a Reviewer's `advance` unless the
  checks pass. The Reviewer's prompt asks it to re-derive the metric
  independently, but its sandbox contains the iteration's artifacts and no code,
  so it never could; a contract can.
- `fanout`'s per-agent `ok` reads the engine's terminal verdict
  (`turnsSucceeded`) instead of "the call did not throw", so an engine that ran,
  failed, and reported the failure cleanly is no longer recorded as a success.
- `council_review` measures against the merge-base of `HEAD` and the first
  `council/*` branch instead of a hardcoded `HEAD~20` window that returned
  nothing on shallow history, and reports files the agents created.
- `CouncilChangedFile.status` is optional and left undefined until a reviewer
  assesses the file. It was hardcoded to `'clean'` for every entry, which read as
  "reviewed and found fine" when nothing had looked at it. The new `change` field
  carries git's own account.
- **UltraApp's build queue is durable.** Its own comment claimed a restart
  mid-build "is marked failed and the user can rerun"; nothing was marked — the
  pending list vanished with the process, along with any queued build the user
  was waiting on. It is persisted and restored now, with an in-flight build
  re-queued at the front rather than resumed, because each build starts from a
  fresh worktree.
- `ultraapp/fix-on-failure.ts` is now an adapter over `src/verify/`; its public
  signature is unchanged.
- One child-process wrapper, one atomic-write helper, one append-JSONL helper,
  and one start→send→stop agent lifecycle replace the four, four, three and five
  near-duplicates that had accumulated.
- The duplicate local `SendOptions` in `session-manager.ts` is gone in favour of
  the canonical one in `types.ts`.

### Fixed

- **A verdict cannot outlive the work.** A node that overruns its timeout is
  abandoned, not killed — JS offers no way to kill it — so a run used to stamp
  `completed / verified` and then have the abandoned attempt write to the
  workspace afterwards: evidence that was accurate when taken and wrong seconds
  later, with nothing recording it. Abandoned attempts are now tracked, and a run
  about to claim `verified` waits briefly for them; if any is still running it
  reports `unverified` with the reason instead of vouching for a tree that may
  yet change. The wait is short and only happens when there is a verdict at
  stake, so one stuck node cannot hold a run open.
- **Resuming with a custom engine works in a fresh process.** `autoloopResume`
  asked the caller to re-supply the credentials the spec deliberately does not
  carry, then dropped them into a map the executor no longer read — so the
  original process succeeded by accident, on secrets still in its memory, and a
  genuine restart got none of them. They go through the run's secret bag now, and
  `workflowResume` accepts them too, which is what makes a custom-engine council
  or fan-out resumable at all.
- Polling `resume` on a finished run no longer mints a lease nobody releases.
  The claim was taken before the terminal check, so a status poll could block the
  next process from restarting it.
- **Resuming a custom-engine run works from the product entry points.** The
  credentials are never persisted, so a crashed run could only be resumed by a
  caller that still had them in memory — which excluded the dashboard and every
  remote caller. `workflow_resume` and the HTTP autoloop resume now take a secret
  _reference_: a name the orchestrator resolves from its own environment
  (`CLAWO_CUSTOM_ENGINE_<REF>`). The name is not sensitive, the value never
  crosses the wire, and an unknown name is an error rather than a silent start
  without credentials.
- **The dashboard's Resume button can resume a custom-engine run.** It sent an
  empty body unconditionally, so the one caller with a button for this was the
  one caller that could not do it. It now asks
  `GET /autoloop/<id>/resume-requirements` which roles used a custom engine and
  prompts for one reference name each.
- Readiness deferreds, live-run handles, the starting marker, and `delete` are
  keyed by the identity of a particular start, not by run id. A run id is reused when a failed start frees
  it, and keying on the id let a dying start clear the retry's deferred — the
  retry then waited forever for a signal with nowhere to land.
- **One execution, one identity.** `Council` and `Fanout` minted their own ids
  and stamped those on every ledger row's `parentRunId`, so the ledger could not
  be grouped by the kernel run a turn belonged to. They take the run id now.
- A cancelled run is `cancelled`, whatever the node returned. A runner that never
  looked at the signal and reported success carried the run to `completed`, so
  "I cancelled it" and "it completed" could both be true. Cancelling also reaches
  the live `Council` / `Fanout` and calls their `abort()`, instead of setting a
  flag and waiting out the node timeout.
- A subflow's child run id is recorded when the child starts, not when it
  finishes — which is to say, it is now recorded in the only window where
  cancelling the parent needs it.
- A workflow spec is validated before it runs: duplicate node ids, `next` and
  router targets naming nodes that do not exist, and negative retry or visit
  bounds are refused up front instead of failing halfway through.
- A contract with no recognised checks is refused. It used to normalise to
  nothing, leaving the run with no contract at all — so a caller who asked to be
  checked was told nothing had checked it, and never saw why.
- Acceptance checks have a timeout. The predecessor pipeline had none, so a
  wedged `npm test` hung a build indefinitely. A check that overruns is killed —
  its whole process group, with SIGKILL — and recorded as failed.
- `steps[].required` is honoured. The field was declared on the old step list and
  never read, so every step was fatal.
- Autoloop's per-iteration `diff.patch` includes files the Coder created. It was
  captured with a bare `git diff`, which lists tracked modifications only, while
  the `git add -A` two lines later committed the new files anyway — so the
  Reviewer audited a picture that structurally could not show them. `files_changed`
  is also taken from git unconditionally; it previously preferred the Coder's own
  claim despite the comment above it saying otherwise.
- `on_target_hit` fires. The push-policy key was declared, defaulted, and
  whitelisted for runtime updates with zero firing sites anywhere — autoloop had
  four ways to notice it was failing and none to notice it had succeeded. A
  passing contract is the signal.
- A `setTimeout` in the ultrareview error path was missing `.unref()`, holding
  the event loop open for 30 minutes after a fan-out that failed to start.
- A node that overran its timeout reported the whole run as `cancelled` rather
  than `failed`, because the timeout and a user cancel shared one signal.

### Execution guarantees

These describe how the new subsystem behaves. Nothing here is an advisory about
an earlier release: the run kernel, its spec files and its per-agent adapters are
all new in this version, so none of these paths exist in 5.x or before.

- **A read-only mode is read-only all the way down.** `ultrareview` builds a
  bespoke prompt and `permissionMode: 'plan'` for each reviewer, and the fan-out
  spec now mirrors the legacy shape field for field so every one of them reaches
  the session. The synthesis pass is held to the same rule: it shares the project
  directory, so a writable synthesiser would undo the read-only agents one step
  later. Asserted by driving a fake session that writes a file whenever its
  permission mode allows it — "was the flag forwarded" is not the question, "did
  the agent get to write" is.
- **Custom-engine credentials never reach disk.** `CustomEngineConfig.env` is for
  environment variables, tokens included. They travel through an in-memory side
  channel that is not part of the checkpoint, and the spec is scrubbed on the way
  out as a second line, so a future field cannot leak by omission. A resume in
  another process is given them again by name — see the secret references above —
  rather than reading them back.
- **One owner per run, and one way to write.** Executing a run means holding a
  `RunGuard`, which names the run's `incarnationId`, the owning kernel's
  `ownerId`, that owner's `acquisitionId`, and a `fence`. Without it, two
  processes each execute a run's nodes — every side effect twice, two writers to
  one checkpoint, one event log interleaving two timelines.

  It is a capability, not a convention:
  - **`commit(guard, batch)` is the only way to change anything durable.**
    Checkpoints, events and node artifacts all go through it, inside one `O_EXCL`
    critical section that verifies the guard first, and the raw writers are no
    longer exported — so there is no path around it. The rule previously lived in
    a comment while the engine wrote checkpoints directly from `start`, `resume`,
    `publish`, `setChild` and the whole result-absorbing path, and a rule
    enforced by a comment is not a rule.
  - **A batch lands whole.** It is staged in a scratch directory and published by
    one atomic directory rename, which is the commit point; what follows is
    replayable application of an already-committed transaction, finished by the
    next reader if the owner died in between. Application is idempotent — the
    manifest records the event log's length from before the batch, so recovery
    truncates and re-appends instead of duplicating. Before this, `committed`
    meant "most of it was attempted": the event append swallowed its own errors,
    so a finished checkpoint could land with its events silently dropped, and a
    batch that failed partway left behind the artifacts it had already written.
  - **Creating a run and claiming it are one step.** The run directory is made
    with a non-recursive `mkdir`, which _is_ the claim. Asking `runExists()` and
    then creating with `{ recursive: true }` is a check-then-write race, and it
    lost routinely: two processes creating the same id 80 times both "succeeded"
    76 times, leaving one workflow executing under another's `spec.json`, or a
    lease belonging to an incarnation that had already been overwritten.
  - **The lock's wait is bounded on every path.** Two of the retry paths out of
    the acquisition loop continued past the deadline check without yielding, so a
    lock that could neither be taken nor broken became a hot loop with no exit —
    not a failure, not a return, just a burnt core. The deadline is checked once
    per iteration now, before anything can continue past it. Found by running the
    suite on CI for the first time, where it presented as a job that went silent
    for fourteen minutes after finishing a test file.
  - **Contention is not a takeover.** `commit` reports `committed`, `superseded`
    or `blocked`, and only `superseded` is permanent. The lock waits briefly
    rather than failing on sight, and an owner that still cannot write stops
    _and hands its claim back_ — because a live local pid is never judged stale,
    so a lease left behind by a stopped run could never be taken over and the run
    was lost for good. One boolean for both failures is what let a millisecond of
    contention wedge a run permanently.
  - **Copy-on-write.** A change is applied to a clone, committed, and adopted
    only if the disk accepted it. A superseded owner therefore does not merely
    fail to persist: the record it hands back to its own caller stops advancing
    too. Refusing the write while returning a record that says `completed`, with
    the output, the cost and a passing verdict on it, is the same claim one layer
    up — and the record is what callers read.
  - **A deleted run id is a new run.** The fence lives in `incarnation.json`,
    which survives releasing the lease (so the counter never restarts while the
    run exists) and dies with the run directory (so the next run under the same
    id gets a fresh random incarnation). Without that, deleting a run and reusing
    its id reset the fence to 1 and an abandoned attempt still holding fence 1
    became valid a second time — an ABA, and not a hypothetical one, because a
    timed-out attempt outlives its run by construction.
  - **Re-acquiring supersedes.** A second claim, even by the same owner, mints a
    new acquisition id and kills the previous guard.
  - **Owner identity is not the pid.** Two `RunKernel`s in one process — two
    SessionManagers is not exotic — share a pid, and treating that as
    re-entrancy let both execute the same run. Each kernel has its own owner id.
  - **Atomic acquisition.** The check and the write happen inside the lock,
    because read-then-write let two racers both conclude they had it.
  - **An independent heartbeat**, not only at checkpoints: a run executing one
    long node makes none, and must not look abandoned for it. On the same host a
    live pid is the authority and is never judged stale for going quiet.

  In-process, starting a run whose id is already live retires the previous run
  first — the same rule, applied where a lease cannot see.

  The UltraApp build queue takes an equivalent claim, with the same corrections
  applied to the same places: read-and-claim happens in one `O_EXCL` critical
  section (two processes starting with no state file both saw "free", and nothing
  wrote an owner until the first enqueue), the owner is an id of its own rather
  than a pid, **every** state write re-checks the claim inside the lock it writes
  in, and that check has the same three outcomes as the run store's. Checking
  only at construction was not ownership — the heartbeat is the same write, so a
  queue that had lapsed and been taken over would stamp itself back in as owner
  on its next persist, clobber the new owner's pending list and run its builds a
  second time. And answering "could not take the lock" with the same `false` as
  "I have been superseded" meant `enqueue` and dispatch carried on through it,
  running a build whose queue state on disk already named a different owner. A
  queue that finds it has been superseded stands down: it stops heartbeating,
  drops its pending list, and refuses `enqueue` and dispatch. A queue that merely
  cannot get the lock refuses the enqueue and re-tries the dispatch, bounded, and
  fails the build with the reason rather than starting it.

- Run ids are validated as a single path segment before any path is derived from
  them. They can be supplied by the caller — including through a tool call — and
  every path in the run store came from `path.join(root, runId)`, with delete
  implemented as a recursive `rmSync`. `../` in an id resolved outside the store,
  so `workflow_delete` could remove an unrelated directory. Reusing an existing
  run id is refused as well: overwriting `spec.json` discarded one run's
  definition while its event log kept growing, leaving a log describing two runs
  and a replay that reconstructed neither.
- A passing verdict no longer survives later edits to the tree it describes.
  Evidence records a digest of the working tree's **content** — HEAD, the full
  `git diff HEAD`, and the bytes of every untracked file — and a
  workspace-touching node running after the verdict causes it to be recomputed at
  the end of the run; if it moved, the outcome drops to `unverified` with the
  reason recorded. (The first attempt hashed `git status --porcelain`, which
  reports a file's _state_, not its bytes: a file already `M` before the checks
  and rewritten afterwards produced an identical digest, so the commonest case —
  an agent editing a file it had already edited — was exactly the one it missed.)
  The `solve` template's reviewer fan-out has moved ahead of the gate — it shared
  the project directory, so reviewers could edit a tree the verifier had already
  signed off while the run still reported `verified`.
- Agent nodes name their session per attempt. A timed-out attempt is abandoned
  rather than killed, and its teardown would otherwise stop the retry's session.
- Cancelling an autoloop run tears the loop down instead of leaving its three
  persistent agents running with their session names claimed — which surfaced
  much later, and far from its cause, as `session name already in use`.
- `autoloopResume` no longer hangs forever on a terminated run. `kernel.resume`
  left terminal runs untouched while the caller awaited a readiness signal that
  was never coming; resuming an autoloop now restarts it, and readiness is raced
  against the run ending.
- The `node:fs` mock in the SessionManager tests no-op'd **every** write in the
  process to keep two files out of the developer's home directory. It now names
  those two files and passes everything else through.

### Testing

- **`src/__tests__/invariants.test.ts`** drives the real public APIs through the
  real kernel, the real node executors and the real `Council` / `Fanout`, with a
  fake engine session as the only seam. No mode assertion in it replaces a node
  executor.

  This exists because the alternative failed. Every other mode test replaces the
  executor and asserts on the spec that reached it, which proves the spec's shape
  and nothing about what ran: that is how a read-only review that could write,
  and a credential written to disk, both shipped with the whole suite green. The
  harness asserts what the runtime actually did — each legacy field arriving at
  the session, a reviewer being unable to write (the fake writes a file whenever
  its permission mode allows it), no secret in any run file, cancel never
  yielding `completed`, a verdict expiring when an already-dirty file changes
  again, and — with a real child process and a real `SIGKILL` — recovery that
  re-runs only the node that was in flight, with a second owner refused.

  Its ownership section is written as races rather than as descriptions of
  races, because the earlier version's names were stronger than its coverage.
  UltraApp's pipeline gets the two assertions the move was made for: the build
  is listed in the run store as a workflow with per-stage node records and a
  build evidence bundle, and a build whose checkpoint says it died after the
  council is resumed without running the council a second time.

  Two real processes create the same forty run ids at the same instant and the
  assertion is that no id was created by both and every id was created by one.
  A real other process holds the lock file while a run tries to write, briefly in
  one test (the run must get through) and past the wait in another (the run must
  stop _and_ give the claim back, so a second kernel can resume it). A batch that
  cannot be staged leaves no artifact, no event and no checkpoint behind, and a
  transaction committed but not applied is finished by the next reader without
  duplicating its events. And an ultraapp queue that hits the lock while a new
  owner is inside it runs nothing.
  Two real processes wait for the same instant and then contend for a claim for a
  fixed window, so neither can win by outliving the other, and the assertion is
  that exactly one ever holds it and exactly one ever commits. Two processes
  contend for an **empty** ultraapp queue — the state that actually broke, which
  a pre-seeded owner never reached — and the assertion is that exactly one build
  runs, not "at most one", which zero also satisfies. A superseded owner really
  attempts a commit, and a takeover is performed by the real acquisition path
  rather than by hand-writing its result. The fresh-process custom-engine resume
  runs `SessionManager.autoloopResume` in a process that never held the config,
  once without the reference and once with it, and asserts the reference is what
  changed the outcome. And the reused-run-id case fires the loser's late cleanup
  while the winner's start is still in flight, rather than after it.

### Removed

- `listCouncilsFromDisk`, `appendAutoloopRegistry`, `upsertAutoloopRegistry`,
  `listAutoloopsFromRegistry`, `removeAutoloopFromRegistry` and the
  `AutoloopRegistryEntry` type. Cross-process listing is `listRuns()`.
- `RESULT_TTL_MS`, `ULTRAREVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` and `GIT_LOG_DEPTH` — the
  eviction, polling and magic-window constants have nothing left to configure.
- No tools were removed. All 69 previous tools keep their behaviour, and a caller
  that declares no contract sees the same completion semantics as 5.1.0.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`engine: 'grok'` — xAI Grok Build.** `grok -p <msg> --output-format json` per send.
  Two things make it unlike the other one-shot engines. Its result object reports
  `total_cost_usd`, so the wrapper passes the engine's own spend straight through
  instead of multiplying tokens by a rate in `models.ts` — the run ledger and the
  `maxBudgetUsd` gate both read what xAI actually charged, and grok's two price
  tiers never have to be modelled. And it reports the model that answered, which
  the router-style engines do not. Conversation continuity is `--resume <sessionId>`,
  confirmed with a two-turn recall test; usage and cost are per-turn, checked by
  resuming and reading turn 2 rather than assumed. `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` is
  **refused**, not approximated: grok's plan mode is model-cooperative and its deny
  rules have not been through the adversarial matrix, so a read-only session throws
  rather than running writable under a read-only label.
- `grok-4.6` in the model registry (500,000-token window, base tier $2/$0.50/$6),
  registered for the context window and an indicative breakdown — not to price turns.

### Changed

- Every reference doc that enumerated engines now lists `grok` and drops `cursor`
  from the offered set — `tools.md`'s `engine` parameter, `sessions.md`, `cli.md`,
  `observability.md`, `openai-compat.md`, `autoloop.md`, `getting-started.md`, `acp.md`.
  Mentions of Cursor as an **MCP or ACP host** are unchanged; that is a different role.
  While there, `autoloop.md` no longer claims Cursor and OpenCode lack native multi-turn
  conversation — both resume by id, and `engineHasNativeConversation` has said so since
  4.12.2.

- **`engine: 'cursor'` is now legacy**, the same treatment `gemini` has: the wrapper
  still works and existing callers are not broken, but it is no longer a documented
  option, is not version-tracked, and gets no new work. Note what this is not —
  Cursor has not been discontinued; Anysphere was acquired by SpaceX (closed
  2026-08-15) and the CLI has shipped since. What pushed it out of the tracked set is
  that Cursor never reports which model actually ran (its init event says
  `"model": "Auto"`), so every cost row is attributed to a hardcoded proxy rate.

### Fixed

- **The `cursor` engine resolved its binary as the bare name `agent`, which is no
  longer unambiguous.** xAI's Grok installer symlinks `agent` to its own binary, so on
  a machine with both, a Cursor session spawned Grok and failed the turn with
  `error: unexpected argument '--force' found`. The wrapper now resolves
  `cursor-agent`, the name Cursor owns; `CURSOR_BIN` still overrides.

## [5.0.0-memento.6] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Forward OpenCode session and per-turn reasoning effort through `--variant`, including resumed sessions; leave provider defaults intact for `auto`.
- Reserve session capacity during concurrent startup so finite limits cannot be bypassed by simultaneous requests.

### Added

- Configure MCP open-session capacity with `CLAWO_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`; `0` explicitly disables the admission limit. Keep the default of five and reject invalid limits.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-08-19

### Breaking

- **`SessionStats.turnsSucceeded` is required, not optional.** Source-breaking
  for a TypeScript consumer that builds a `SessionStats` object of its own
  (implementing `ISession`, or a test double); runtime consumers reading the
  field are unaffected. Required on purpose: it makes `tsc` enumerate the four
  places in `src/` that own a stats object instead of leaving one silently
  `undefined`.

- **`BaseOneShotSession._recordTurnComplete()` now takes a required `ok`
  argument.** The class is exported, so the `protected` method is part of the
  published subclassing surface: an out-of-tree engine subclass calling it with
  no argument fails to compile, and in plain JS would record every turn as
  failed.

### Added

- **`turnsSucceeded` on `SessionStats` — `turns` never meant the turn
  succeeded.** It is incremented at ten sites that mean three different things:
  the `user` echo of a message going out before any result exists (`claude`, and
  a persistent `custom`), reaching process close whatever the outcome (the five
  `BaseOneShotSession` engines plus a one-shot `custom`), and a `turn/completed`
  notification that may itself report a non-completed status (`codex-app`). None
  of them is the reading its writer's name — `_recordTurnComplete()` — invites.

  `turns` keeps its meaning and is now documented as "turns that reached the
  engine, whatever their outcome". `turnsSucceeded` counts only the ones the
  engine reported as successful, and the predicate is the engine's own terminal
  verdict rather than the exit code: `codex` fails a turn that emits
  `turn.failed` while exiting 0, `agy` requires `SUCCESS` _and_ a zero exit,
  `gemini` succeeds on exit 53 (its turn limit resolves), `codex-app` requires
  `status: 'completed'`, and `opencode` refuses a turn on purpose when read-only
  enforcement did not load. On the one-shot engines the counter and that turn's
  `stop_reason` come from one expression, so they cannot disagree; `gemini` and
  `codex-app` keep their own `stop_reason` mapping (`turn_limit`, `interrupted`)
  and the counter is the stricter of the two.

  **`turns` is not one-per-send on every engine, so the difference between the
  two counters is the failure count on the one-shot engines only.** On `claude`
  and a persistent `custom`, `turns` counts `user` events and the CLI emits one
  per tool-result batch as well as the prompt echo — a send that used eight tools
  counts nine. `turnsSucceeded` _is_ one-per-send everywhere, so compare it
  against sends there, not against `turns`. Measured against claude-code
  stream-json, not inferred.

  Exposed as `turns_succeeded` on `/v1/sessions` (openai-compat sessions) and in
  `health().details`.

- Registry entries for `claude-mythos-5` (Fable 5 parity) and for the 4.5
  generation, `claude-sonnet-4-5` and `claude-opus-4-5` — still served, and
  200,000-token models, so leaving them out measured them against a 1M
  denominator.

- **`clawo runs` printed a bare `error:` label for a failed turn that carried no
  error text.** Since the ledger's `ok` reads the session's `turnsSucceeded`
  counter, a turn the engine declined to count as succeeded — an interrupted
  `codex-app` turn, a non-SUCCESS `agy` turn — resolves without throwing, so
  `ok` is `false` while `error` is absent. Those rows now read `not counted as
succeeded`, and `observability.md` says that `error` is not guaranteed on a
  failed row.

### Fixed

- **A turn the engine itself reported as failed could be recorded as successful
  work in the run ledger.** The row's `ok` was "nothing was thrown", which is a
  weaker statement than the engine's own verdict, and three cases resolved
  cleanly while having failed: `agy` exiting 0 with a non-SUCCESS status, a
  `codex-app` turn cancelled through `interrupt()` (its `turn/completed` reports
  `status: 'interrupted'`), and a `claude` or persistent `custom` CLI that dies
  mid-turn and resolves with `stop_reason: 'process_exit'`. `ok` now reads the
  session's own counter — the row is successful when `turnsSucceeded` moved — so
  the ledger and `/v1/sessions` cannot disagree about the same turn. When the
  counter cannot be read at all (a `getStats()` that throws), it falls back to
  the old meaning rather than reporting a telemetry failure as a turn failure.

  The cost of a failed turn still counts against `maxBudgetUsd`: that gate reads
  `costUsd` and has never distinguished successful from failed work. What changes
  is only that the row records the outcome honestly.

- **`codex-app` counted an interrupted turn as a completed one.** The engine's
  `TurnStatus` is `completed | interrupted | failed | inProgress`, and
  `interrupt()` on that session produces `interrupted` on purpose, so testing for
  the absence of `failed` treated a cancellation as a success.

- **`agy` could report `SUCCESS` and still exit non-zero, and a failure it had
  already reported could be erased by a later `SUCCESS` in the same turn.** The
  status is now recorded sticky-on-failure and the exit code stays in the
  outcome expression, so a turn whose promise rejects is never counted as one
  that succeeded.

- **Claude Sonnet 5 was priced 50% too high.** The registry carried $3/$15 per
  Mtok on purpose: $2/$10 had been announced as introductory pricing through
  2026-08-31, and pricing the scheduled rate avoided under-reporting. Anthropic
  has since made $2/$10 the standard price and cancelled the September increase,
  so the entry now over-reported every Sonnet turn — including through the
  `maxBudgetUsd` gate, which trips on these numbers, and `sonnet` is the alias
  the CLI itself defaults to. Now $2/$10 with a $0.20 cache read.
- **`gpt-5.6` was unregistered** and fell back to Sonnet pricing and a 200,000
  context window, over-reporting `contextPercent` by 5.25x. It is a documented
  model (1,050,000 window, $5/$0.50/$30 — identical to `gpt-5.6-sol`) and codex
  0.148.0 offers it. `gpt-5.6-pro` appears in the codex binary but has no
  model-docs page, so it stays unregistered rather than carry invented pricing.

## [4.14.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Antigravity sessions failed outright on agy 1.1.13, and the engine-agnostic
  reasoning-effort setting was never forwarded.** `agy models` now lists only
  effort-qualified slugs, and the CLI rejects an unsuffixed base slug that
  arrives without `--effort` — which is exactly what the adapter sent, so the
  two documented aliases (`agy-flash`, `agy-pro`) could not start a turn at all.
  Session defaults and per-turn overrides are now forwarded as `--effort`. agy
  accepts only `low`, `medium` and `high`, so the shared `max`/`xhigh` aliases
  clamp to `high`; `auto` resolves an unsuffixed slug to `high`; an
  already-qualified `-low`/`-medium`/`-high` slug keeps its own effort; and a
  conflicting per-turn override strips the suffix before passing the new effort,
  avoiding agy's model/effort conflict error. Thanks to @metahacker (#82).

  Note that agy models do not all expose the same tiers — `gemini-3.1-pro`
  offers `low` and `high` only — so an effort a model lacks is refused by agy
  rather than silently substituted.

- **An `agy` turn that agy itself rejected surfaced as `Antigravity exited with
code 1`.** agy reports a rejected invocation as a stream-json `result` event
  carrying `error` and prints nothing on stderr, so the specific message — which
  names the values it will accept — was discarded. It is now surfaced as the
  turn's error, including when agy exits 0 while reporting one.

## [4.14.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Run ledger — a durable, cross-engine record of every turn.** Each completed
  turn appends one JSON line to `~/.claw-orchestrator/runs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
  (override with `CLAWO_RUNS_DIR`): session, engine, model, cwd, turn index,
  per-turn token/cost/tool deltas, duration, success, error text, and the
  council / fanout / autoloop id it belonged to. Until now cost and token
  counts lived only in memory and per-session history was capped and evicted,
  so nothing survived a restart. Writes are best-effort — a ledger failure is
  logged and swallowed, never allowed to break the turn it describes.
- **`clawo runs`** — query the ledger from the CLI:
  `clawo runs [--since 30m|24h|7d|<ISO>] [--session <name>] [--engine <engine>]
[--parent <run id>] [-n <limit>] [--json]`. Also exposed as `GET /runs`
  (query string or JSON body) and `manager.getRunLedger()`, both returning rows
  plus a summary with a per-engine cost breakdown.
- **Dashboard 24-hour spend indicator**, fed by the same endpoint.
- `session_list` / `GET /session/list` now report `costUsd`, `budgetUsd` and
  `budgetExhausted`, so a session that has stopped accepting turns shows why.
- `SessionStats.tokensEstimated` marks turns whose token counts came from
  `estimateTokens()` because the engine reported no usage. The ledger carries
  the flag per row and `clawo runs` marks those costs with a trailing `~`, so an
  estimate is never presented as a measurement.
- New reference doc `skills/references/observability.md` covering the row
  schema, the query surfaces, spend-cap semantics, and which engines report real
  usage versus estimating it.

### Fixed

- **`maxBudgetUsd` was silently ignored on every engine except Claude Code.**
  The option is documented as "Max API spend (USD)" on `session_start`, and
  council and fanout pass it to each agent, but the only thing it ever did was
  append `--max-budget-usd` to the `claude` CLI — a council of Codex agents ran
  with no cap at all. The cap is now enforced in `SessionManager`, which every
  engine passes through: once a session's cumulative cost reaches it, further
  sends are refused with a typed `BudgetExceededError` carrying session, engine,
  spend and cap, before the engine is spawned. Claude Code still receives the
  flag as well, since an in-CLI stop happens earlier and costs less. Note that
  on engines that estimate token counts the cap is best-effort — see
  `observability.md`.

- **Claude engine sessions failed with `Invalid API key` when the host process
  carried a proxy-scoped `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.** The spawn environment inherits
  `process.env`, so a key meant for a local proxy leaked into `claude` child
  processes that had no `baseUrl` configured; the CLI prefers such a key over its
  own subscription login and sends it to the official API, which rejects it. The
  key is now dropped from the child environment when it does not use the
  official `sk-ant-` format and neither the session `baseUrl` option nor an
  ambient `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set. Official-format keys and sessions that
  explicitly target a proxy are unaffected.

## [4.13.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Six `autoloop_*` tools were registered but never declared in
  `openclaw.plugin.json`.** `autoloop_start`, `autoloop_chat`, `autoloop_status`,
  `autoloop_list`, `autoloop_reset_agent` and `autoloop_stop` have been missing from
  the manifest since autoloop shipped, so a host that reads the declared contract
  rather than the runtime registration never saw them. The manifest now declares all
  69 registered tools.

- **The tool count disagreed with itself in three places** — 69 actually registered,
  65 in README.md and SKILL.md, 63 in CLAUDE.md and the manifest. All now say 69.

### Added

- A parity test between `openclaw.plugin.json` and the tools the plugin actually
  registers, plus a duplicate-name check. The manifest is maintained by hand
  alongside the code that registers tools, so it drifts silently; the test names the
  offending tool instead of reporting a count mismatch. Verified to fail when a tool
  is removed from the manifest.

### Changed

- New README banner: an architecture diagram of the real system — entrypoints,
  session layer, engines, orchestration — replacing the previous one, which still
  advertised the retired Gemini engine and omitted Antigravity and OpenCode.

## [4.13.1] - 2026-08-17

Driving 4.13.0 from a real editor turned up one thing the protocol alone could not
tell us, so this corrects both the behaviour and a documentation claim.

### Added

- **A slash command per session mode** — `/single`, `/council`, `/ultraplan`,
  `/ultrareview` — advertised through `available_commands_update` when the session
  opens. Text after the command runs in that mode straight away, so
  `/council fix the failing test` is one step rather than three.

  This exists because **whether a client renders a mode picker is up to the client**.
  ACP defines `modes` on `session/new` and `session/set_mode`, but the VS Code ACP
  extension (0.2.0, measured) renders config options and not modes — without a
  command surface the orchestration modes were simply unreachable there. The docs
  previously stated the client "renders it as a picker"; that was inferred from the
  protocol, not observed, and is now corrected.

### Fixed

- Resolving a parked council restored an **empty** command list, which wiped the mode
  commands along with the gate commands and left the client with no way back to any
  mode. It now restores the mode commands.
- `/single <task>` (and any mode command carrying text) passed the raw line, slash
  command included, to the engine. The command is now stripped.

### Verified in an editor

4.13.0 and this release were driven from VS Code with the ACP Client extension 0.2.0:
the agent appears in the agents list beside GitHub Copilot, Claude Code and Codex CLI,
connects, renders the engine-grouped model dropdown and the permission selector, and
answered a prompt about a workspace file with its tool calls shown as collapsible
entries. Closing the editor also confirmed the server exits on client disconnect
rather than lingering.

## [4.13.0] - 2026-08-17

MCP gives tools _to_ an agent; ACP makes you _be_ the agent. Every agent in the
Agent Client Protocol ecosystem is a single agent — this one is a fleet.

### Added

- **`clawo acp` — run the orchestrator as an Agent Client Protocol agent.** Speaks
  ACP over JSON-RPC stdio, so Zed, JetBrains, Neovim, Emacs and the VS Code ACP
  extension can drive it as their coding agent, as can `dsh` through its
  `subagent-acp` provider (which takes an arbitrary command, so no plugin code is
  needed either side). Also available as the `clawo-acp` binary. Built against
  **stable ACP v1** (`@agentclientprotocol/sdk`, pinned `1.3.0`); ACP v2 is a draft
  whose wire protocol may change incompatibly in any SDK release, so it is not used.

- **A model selector that spans engines.** `session/new` returns a `category:"model"`
  config option whose values are grouped by engine and built from the shared registry,
  so one dropdown in the editor holds Claude, Codex and Cursor models at once and
  changing it switches engine mid-session — verified by switching a live session from
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` to `gpt-5.5` and getting the answer back from Codex. The sunset
  `gemini` engine is omitted; `opencode` has no entries because its models are
  open-ended `provider/model` strings with nothing to enumerate.

- **Session modes carry the orchestration.** `single` · `council` · `ultraplan` ·
  `ultrareview` are advertised and switchable, and each dispatches:
  - `council` runs several engines in isolated git worktrees. Each agent becomes a
    `tool_call` the client can collapse, each round emits a `plan`, and the synthesis
    arrives as text. Agent deltas are buffered per agent onto that agent's
    `tool_call_update` rather than streamed into the text channel — several agents
    speak at once, and a consumer that reads only text would receive them interleaved
    into one unreadable blob. Defaults are far below the library's own (two agents on
    distinct engines, three rounds, against three agents and fifteen rounds), because
    a client is waiting; even so, a measured two-round run took ~9 minutes.
  - Consensus **parks** the run rather than finishing it, so the turn ends at the gate
    and `/council_accept` and `/council_reject <feedback>` are advertised through
    `available_commands_update`. Any other prompt while parked is refused, so a second
    run cannot start over the same worktrees.
  - `ultraplan` and `ultrareview` are poll-only upstream, so progress is reported as
    thought chunks and the result arrives as both a `plan` update and text.

- `usage_update` reports context occupancy and **cumulative cross-engine cost** — the
  number worth showing here, since a session that switched engines mid-way has spent on
  both and no single-engine agent can report it.

### Fixed

- **A stdio-protocol host could corrupt its own frames.** `SessionManager` was
  constructed without a logger in the plugin entry, so it fell back to the console
  logger, whose `info`/`debug` write to **stdout** — the channel `clawo-mcp` reserves
  for MCP frames. The host's logger is now passed through.

### Known limitations

- `session/cancel` settles the turn immediately, but the session layer has no mid-turn
  cancel: the underlying session is destroyed and recreated, so partial work in that
  turn is lost.
- `session/request_permission` is not implemented. Permission resolves once into engine
  CLI flags at session start and nothing can surface a mid-turn request, so the choice
  is offered as a session config option instead.
- `loadSession` is advertised as `false`; ACP-level resume is not wired to the engines'
  own resume handles yet.
- Ultraplan has no abort path upstream, so cancelling it abandons the poll rather than
  stopping the work.
- `/council_accept` and `/council_reject` are covered by unit tests against a fake
  manager but have not been exercised against a live parked council.

## [4.12.2] - 2026-08-17

A regression introduced in 4.12.0 and present in 4.12.1: a turn that reset the
conversation reached the engine without the caller's system prompt. Reported in
[#79](https://github.com/Enderfga/claw-orchestrator/issues/79).

### Fixed

- **openai-compat: a reset turn silently lost the system prompt.**
  `threadHasHistory` is resolved before message extraction, from the session that
  exists at that moment. A reset then stops that session and starts a new one, but
  the value was never recomputed — so on that turn the bridge concluded the prompt
  was already in the transcript while the engine had a brand new thread holding
  nothing, and answered 200 with no identity and no workspace context. The gate now
  carries the `!needsCreate` term the tool-schema gate has had since 4.11.0: a turn
  that creates a conversation always sends the prompt, a genuine resume still skips
  it. Affects `codex`, `codex-app`, `agy`, `cursor` and `opencode`; `claude` was
  never affected, as it receives the prompt through the session config. It matters
  beyond hand-set headers — a proxy that retries by setting `X-Session-Reset: 1`
  hits it on the first retry after any live turn.

- **`cursor` and `opencode` claimed a live conversation they might not have.**
  4.12.0 moved them to the native-conversation side of the bridge without giving
  them a case in `nativeThreadIsLive()`, so they fell through to its `default:
true` — the "session is in the manager's map" signal that predicate exists to
  replace. A session whose first turn died before the engine announced an id was
  then indistinguishable from a healthy one, and lost the caller's system prompt
  and tool schemas on every subsequent turn rather than just once. Both engines
  already capture an id; those ids are now surfaced on `SessionStats`
  (`cursorChatId`, `opencodeSessionId`) and checked.

### Added

- First unit coverage for `handleChatCompletion`. It had none, which is how the
  above shipped: the validation for 4.12.0 exercised a multi-hop tool
  continuation, and a tool continuation returns from message extraction before the
  reset header is ever read, so the recreate path was never run.

## [4.12.1] - 2026-08-15

Codex's token usage was being read as if it were per-turn. It is cumulative, so
every number derived from it — session cost, context occupancy, and the
auto-compaction gate that depends on it — was wrong. Reported in
[#75](https://github.com/Enderfga/claw-orchestrator/issues/75).

### Fixed

- **Codex session cost was overstated, without bound.** `turn.completed.usage`
  reports totals for the whole thread, not the turn, and the wrapper added each
  one to a running sum — a sum of running totals. With a steady prompt of size P,
  N turns reported `P*N*(N+1)/2` against a true `P*N`, so the error grew with
  every turn: 2x at three turns, 3.5x at six. Measured against codex 0.147.0,
  which reports `input_tokens` 13,856 → 27,727 → 41,613 for three identical
  trivial turns, each value matching `total_token_usage` in that thread's rollout
  file exactly. The totals are now assigned, as the app-server wrapper has always
  done.

- **`contextPercent` measured neither the thread nor the window, on either codex
  engine.** The numerator inherited the cumulative reading above, which can only
  climb — so the figure was monotonic by construction and pinned at 100 on a long
  session, regardless of how full the context actually was. The denominator was
  the model's published window from the registry (1,050,000 for gpt-5.x) while
  codex enforces 258,400 and fails the request there. The two errors pull in
  opposite directions, so no correction factor could fix it. Both engines now
  divide the turn's own prompt — which for a thread-resuming engine is the live
  occupancy — by the limit codex reports: `exec` harvests `model_context_window`
  from the thread's rollout file, and `app-server` reads `last` and
  `modelContextWindow` straight off the `thread/tokenUsage/updated` notification
  it already received. Verified end to end against 0.147.0 on both engines, with
  the wrapper's figures checked against that thread's rollout after every turn.

- **Resuming a codex thread no longer reports a nearly-full context on its first
  send.** That first `turn.completed` carries a total covering turns this process
  never saw, which was read as one enormous prompt. The baseline is now seeded
  from the rollout, so the first turn measures its own prompt (verified: 6% where
  it previously read 22%). Best-effort throughout — an unreadable, absent or
  `--ephemeral` rollout falls back to the registry window and a zero baseline.

- **A one-shot engine that cannot compact now says so.** The auto-compaction gate
  calls `compact()` and discards the result, so on `codex`, `agy`, `cursor` and
  `opencode` the gate did nothing and left no trace: the thread grew until the
  CLI refused it, with nothing in the log explaining why. These sessions now emit
  one warning on their log channel the first time compaction is requested.

### Changed

- Codex tested version → 0.147.0. Re-ran the read-only probe matrix on it (direct
  write, shell redirect, delegate-to-subagent, each repeated on a resumed turn):
  no writes, so the `-c sandbox_mode=` restatement from 4.10.1 still holds.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-08-14

Three engines were being driven as if they could not hold a conversation. They
all could; the wrappers just never used it.

### Added

- `crossSessionInbound` session option (Claude engine): `accept` / `hold` /
  `refuse`, setting how this session treats peer messages from other Claude Code
  sessions on the same machine. There is no CLI flag for this — it is a settings
  key, so it rides the existing `--settings` merge alongside `ultracode`. It is
  worth setting explicitly on an orchestrated session: with no value the CLI
  decides from the two sides' permission modes and holds when they differ, and an
  orchestrated session (`bypassPermissions` / `acceptEdits`) talking to a human's
  terminal (prompting) is exactly that case, so the message parks waiting for an
  approval in a terminal nobody is watching. Sessions started by the orchestrator
  do register as addressable peers and do receive messages — verified against
  2.1.232 by sending to a live one and getting a reply.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode and Cursor now continue their own conversation.** `opencode run`
  opens a new session unless `--session <id>` names one, and `agent -p` opens a
  new chat unless `--resume <chatId>` does — and both wrappers were already
  capturing that id off the event stream, then never passing it back. Every send
  was therefore an amnesiac first turn. Verified against opencode 1.18.18 and
  cursor 2026.08.11: before, turn 2 answers "you never asked me to remember
  anything"; after, it returns the word from turn 1. `--continue` is deliberately
  not used for either — it means "the most recent conversation on this machine",
  which collides between concurrent sessions.
- **`engineHasNativeConversation()` now counts `opencode` and `cursor`.** They sat
  on the amnesiac side of that predicate, which was never a property of the CLIs.
  While it lasted, the autoloop replayed a character-capped (therefore
  truncating) transcript to them every turn, and the openai-compat bridge re-sent
  the entire tool schema block, every tool result, and the system prompt every
  turn. Those three savings, added in 4.11.0 for codex/agy, now apply here too.
- **Antigravity reports real token usage.** agy grew `--output-format
stream-json`, whose `result` event carries input/output/cache-read tokens; the
  wrapper had been estimating ~4 chars per token from the message text, which
  under-counted a real turn by more than two orders of magnitude (a short prompt
  measured 27 estimated tokens against ~15k actual). Cost for this engine was a
  guess and is now measured. The conversation id also comes off the `init` event,
  so the log-file scrape is now only a fallback for a turn that dies before
  emitting anything, and a non-`SUCCESS` status is reflected in `stop_reason`.

- The upstream system prompt was prepended to the user message on every turn for
  every non-Claude engine. For engines that resume a conversation it is already in
  the transcript, so each hop added another full copy — 60k+ characters per hop for
  a large caller. It is now sent only when the conversation is not known to already
  hold it, using the same predicate as the tool reminder. That predicate also covers
  the `agy` case where a missing conversation id would otherwise mean silently
  starting fresh: without the id the full prompt is still sent.

- Tool results were re-serialized in full on every hop of a tool loop. On engines
  that resume a conversation the earlier results are already in the transcript, so
  each hop re-sent the whole history and the prompt grew quadratically: with a 30k
  character batch per round, hop 10 carried ~300k characters the engine had already
  seen. Results are now scoped to the round that answers the engine's latest
  assistant turn whenever the conversation is known to hold the rest — same
  predicate as the tool reminder. Sessions whose thread cannot be confirmed keep
  sending everything.

- The resume-turn tool reminder was gated on the session existing in the manager's
  map, which is not the same as the engine having created a conversation.
  `start()` does not spawn a process, the conversation id is only captured later
  (`codex` on `thread.started`, `agy` by harvesting the log after the first turn),
  and a send that fails before that point leaves the session in the map with no id.
  The next turn then sent a reminder referring to tools the engine had never
  received — no schemas, no identity, no history — and still answered 200. The gate
  now also requires the id to be present, so a conversation that was never created
  falls back to the full block. Behaviour is unchanged once a thread is live.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- The openai-compat bridge prepended the full tool-schema block to every turn on
  any non-Claude engine. For engines that resume a thread (`codex`, `codex-app`,
  `agy`) that block stays in the transcript, so the prompt grew by the size of the
  whole schema set on each turn and long tool-use loops died with a context-window
  error. Resume turns now get a short reminder of the calling convention instead —
  at 54 tools that is ~450 characters in place of ~21,000. Engines that start
  fresh every send (`cursor`, `opencode`, `gemini`) still get the full block,
  because for them nothing persists. A newly created session always gets the full
  block, as does any request whose tool list changed (the tool list is part of the
  session key), and `OPENAI_COMPAT_TOOLS_PER_MESSAGE=1` still re-sends everything
  every turn. Reported with measurements in #74.
- `contextPercent` was hardcoded to `0` for every one-shot engine, so anything
  gating on it — including the bridge's auto-compaction — could never trigger, and
  a growing thread hard-failed instead of being compacted. It is now derived from
  the most recent turn's input tokens against the model's context window. The
  running `tokensIn` total is not usable for this: it sums every turn, so it climbs
  even for engines that start from an empty prompt each send.

### Added

- `engineHasNativeConversation(engine, customEngine?)` is now exported from
  `types.ts`, replacing a private copy in the autoloop dispatcher. It answers
  whether an engine carries conversation state itself, which decides who is
  responsible for re-sending per-turn context.

### Changed

- Tested engine versions: Claude Code 2.1.220 → 2.1.221, OpenCode 1.18.9 →
  1.18.13, Antigravity 1.1.8 → 1.1.10. Codex (0.146.0) and Cursor (2026.07.23)
  are unchanged. No wrapper changes were needed, and read-only enforcement was
  re-verified across all four engines on the full probe matrix.

## [4.10.1] - 2026-08-01

Weekly engine sweep. Two `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` guarantees did not hold and
now do. Both were found by broadening the adversarial probe set — one to a second
turn, one to prompts that ask the agent to delegate — and both are reproducible.

### Fixed

- **Codex read-only only covered the first turn.** `codex exec resume` rejects
  `--sandbox`, and the wrapper assumed the resumed thread inherited the policy
  from the first turn. It does not: against 0.146.0, a `read-only` session wrote
  to disk on turn 2 on every attempt. The mode is now restated as a
  `-c sandbox_mode="<mode>"` override on every resume, which the CLI does accept.
  Write-enabled sessions are unaffected.
- **OpenCode read-only could be escaped by delegating.** The generated
  `clawo-readonly` agent denied `edit` / `bash` / `external_directory`, but not
  `task` — so the agent handed the write to a subagent, which runs under the
  default writable agent. Prompts that asked for delegation wrote to disk on
  every attempt while direct-write prompts were correctly blocked, which is why
  earlier probes missed it. The agent now denies `task` and `webfetch` as well
  and drops those tools outright via its `tools` map. Claude and Cursor read-only
  were checked against the same delegation prompts and hold.

### Changed

- Tested engine versions: Codex 0.145.0 → 0.146.0, OpenCode 1.18.5 → 1.18.9,
  Antigravity 1.1.7 → 1.1.8. Claude Code (2.1.220) and Cursor (2026.07.23) are
  unchanged. No other wrapper changes were needed: every engine's flags, event
  schema and token fields are unchanged.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-07-25

Weekly engine sweep. Every version below was re-verified against the real binary,
including adversarial write attempts against each read-only mode.

### Added

- Registered `claude-opus-5` in the model registry, and pointed the `opus` alias at
  it to match what the Claude CLI's own `opus` alias resolves to. Sessions that use
  the alias already ran on Opus 5 — the CLI resolves it — but the registry attributed
  their cost and context window to Opus 4.8.

### Fixed

- Corrected context windows for the Anthropic models, which drive the context-used
  percentage reported for a session: `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-opus-4-7`,
  `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-sonnet-4-6` were all registered with a 200,000-token
  window and are 1,000,000. A session on any of them under-reported context use by
  5x. `claude-haiku-4-5` is unchanged at 200,000.

### Changed

- Tested engine versions: Claude Code 2.1.217 → 2.1.220, OpenCode 1.18.4 → 1.18.5,
  Antigravity 1.1.5 → 1.1.7, Cursor 2026.07.20 → 2026.07.23. Codex is unchanged at
  0.145.0. No wrapper changes were needed: every engine's flags, event schema and
  token fields are unchanged, and the read-only enforcement for Claude, Cursor and
  OpenCode still holds under adversarial write attempts.

## [4.9.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Fixed two racy Ultraapp manager tests that could fail on a loaded machine. Both
  drained the build queue by polling the persisted run mode, then asserted on
  subscriber events; because the manager persists the mode before emitting the
  matching event, the loop could exit while the terminal event was still
  undelivered. They now wait for the event they assert on. Test-only change —
  no runtime behaviour is affected.

## [4.9.1] - 2026-07-22

Weekly engine sweep. Every version below was re-verified against the real binary,
including adversarial write attempts against each read-only mode.

### Fixed

- Corrected context windows in the model registry, which drives the context-used
  percentage reported for a session. Every GPT-5.6 tier is 1,050,000 (Luna was
  registered as 400,000); `gpt-5.5` 1,000,000 → 1,050,000; `gpt-5.4` 256,000 →
  1,050,000; `gpt-5.4-mini` 256,000 → 400,000; `gpt-5.4-nano` 128,000 → 400,000.
  Values now come from OpenAI's per-model documentation. Note that the Codex CLI
  ships a model config reporting 272,000 for these ids — that is the CLI's own
  cap and the long-context price breakpoint, not the model's context window, and
  is deliberately not mirrored here.

### Changed

- Tested engine versions: Claude Code 2.1.212 → 2.1.217, Codex 0.144.5 → 0.145.0,
  OpenCode 1.18.0 → 1.18.4, Antigravity 1.1.1 → 1.1.5, Cursor 2026.07.09 →
  2026.07.20. No wrapper changes were needed: every engine's flags, event schema
  and token fields are unchanged, and the read-only enforcement for Claude,
  Cursor and OpenCode still holds under adversarial write attempts.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-07-17

Weekly engine sweep. Every version below was re-verified against the real binary
rather than taken from release notes.

### Added

- `forwardSubagentText` session option (Claude engine) — passes `--forward-subagent-text`
  (CLI 2.1.211+) so a session that fans out to subagents surfaces their text and thinking
  in the output stream instead of going quiet until the subagent returns.

### Changed

- Tested engine versions: Claude Code 2.1.207 → 2.1.212, Codex 0.144.1 → 0.144.5,
  OpenCode 1.17.15 → 1.18.0. Antigravity (1.1.1) and Cursor (2026.07.09) unchanged.
  No wrapper changes were needed: OpenCode's JSON event schema, token fields, and
  agent-fallback message are unchanged across the 1.17 → 1.18 bump, and Codex's
  `exec --json` event schema and thread resume are unchanged across 0.144.x.

## [4.8.1] - 2026-07-12

Hardening pass after upgrading and re-verifying the OpenCode, Cursor, and Antigravity
CLIs against their real binaries (OpenCode 1.1.40 → 1.17.15, Cursor 2026.04.08 →
2026.07.09, Antigravity 1.1.1). Every read-only guarantee below was checked by
attempting an actual adversarial write against the installed CLI, not by trusting a
flag or the model's self-report.

### Fixed

- **Cursor read-only is now genuinely enforced.** `sandboxMode: 'read-only'` previously
  relied on `--mode plan`, which Cursor documents as steering "rather than enforcing
  permissions" — an adversarial prompt could still make edit-tool calls write files.
  Read-only Cursor sessions now run against a binding `.cursor/cli.json` deny config
  (`Write`/`Edit`/`Shell` denied), which was verified to hold even under `--force` and
  even against a repository that ships a permissive config of its own. The config lives
  in an isolated temp dir used as the process cwd (with `--workspace` pointing at the
  real project), so the user's repository is never modified. Read/grep/search still work.
- **Cursor tool-call metrics restored.** Cursor 2026.05+ emits `tool_call`
  (`subtype: started|completed`) instead of the older `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair, so
  `toolCalls`/`toolErrors` had silently stopped incrementing. Both event shapes are now
  handled. Token accounting and assistant-text extraction were unaffected (schema
  re-verified field-by-field).
- **OpenCode read-only fails closed.** If the injected `clawo-readonly` enforcement agent
  fails to load, OpenCode 1.17.15 prints a warning and silently runs the default,
  _writable_ agent. A read-only session now detects that fallback and refuses the turn
  rather than returning output produced without its sandbox.

### Changed

- Tested-engine pins updated to Cursor Agent **2026.07.09-a3815c0** and OpenCode
  **1.17.15**. OpenCode's `run --format json` event schema, token field path
  (`step_finish.part.tokens`), and agent-permission config were diffed at both tags and
  are unchanged; Antigravity 1.1.1's conversation-resume log line and all wrapper flags
  were re-verified end-to-end. No wrapper change was required for OpenCode or Antigravity.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Per-role Autoloop engines** (closes #72). Planner, Coder, and Reviewer can independently use any built-in engine; a custom engine may additionally be supplied by a local caller. Existing runs keep the Claude defaults (`opus` for Planner, `sonnet` for Coder/Reviewer); non-Claude roles use their engine's default model when no model is supplied. Planner `spawn_subagents` can override Coder/Reviewer engine and model without accepting custom configuration data.
- **Conversation replay for engines without native multi-turn.** Claude (persistent process), Codex (thread resume) and Antigravity (`--conversation`) carry context themselves; Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode and one-shot custom engines spawn a fresh process per send, so the dispatcher now replays the role's transcript in-band (`<conversation_history>`, oldest turns dropped past a character budget). Without this a non-Claude Planner forgot the plan it had just proposed on every turn.
- **`sandboxMode: 'read-only'` is now enforced on every engine that accepts it**, not just Codex: Claude maps it to plan mode, Gemini to `--approval-mode plan` **plus an admin policy denying `exit_plan_mode`** (plan mode alone is model-cooperative and can be escaped), Antigravity/Cursor to their plan modes, and OpenCode to a generated `clawo-readonly` agent whose permissions deny `edit`/`bash`/`external_directory` (its built-in `plan` agent is a user-overridable preset that denies neither). A custom engine that cannot express read-only now refuses to start rather than silently running write-enabled.

### Changed

- Built-in non-Claude Autoloop roles receive their role protocol in-band. Non-Claude Planners start in their engine's read-only/plan mode.
- Autoloop registry entries retain each role's effective engine/model selection, including successful `spawn_subagents` overrides, and are now written as an upsert — a run keeps one row instead of accumulating one per start, spawn and resume.
- `spawn_subagents` rejects engine/model changes after the corresponding session starts, rolls back a newly started Coder if Reviewer startup fails, and drops a prior model when switching to a different engine without an explicit replacement. If a rollback stop fails, the role stays marked as started so a later engine change is rejected rather than silently reusing the old engine's process.
- Invalid role engines, malformed or missing custom configurations, reserved session-name collisions, and failed Planner startup fail explicitly without leaving a half-created run. Deleting a run whose Planner is still starting is now rejected instead of orphaning the session. HTTP surfaces every custom-engine config complaint as a 400 rather than a 500.
- Codex sessions persist the real thread ID, so resumed Codex Planners retain their conversation instead of starting a fresh thread.
- Tested-engine pins updated to Claude Code **2.1.207**, Codex **0.144.1**, Gemini **0.43.0**, Antigravity **1.1.1**, Cursor Agent **2026.04.08-a41fba1**, and OpenCode **1.1.40**.

### Notes

- **Custom engines are local-only by design.** A custom engine names an executable to spawn (plus argv and env), so it may only be configured by a local caller — the MCP tool or the `SessionManager` API. The HTTP API (`POST /autoloop/new`, `POST /autoloop/<id>/resume`) accepts built-in engines only and rejects a `*_custom_engine` body field with a 400. The embedded server is often reverse-tunnelled and its token is a monitoring credential; it is not a channel for choosing what binary the host runs.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **First-class Google Antigravity engine (`engine: 'agy'`).** Wraps the `agy` CLI —
  Google's successor to Gemini CLI (consumer Gemini CLI tiers stopped serving
  2026-06-18) — as a built-in one-shot engine, replacing the custom-engine recipe.
  Beyond the recipe it adds: **conversation continuity** (agy logs
  `Created conversation <uuid>`; the engine passes a private `--log-file`, harvests
  the ID after the first turn, and resumes with `--conversation <id>` — seedable via
  `resumeSessionId`, exposed as `stats.agyConversationId`), **timeout coherence**
  (`--print-timeout` derived from the send timeout), permission-mode mapping
  (`bypassPermissions` → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `default` → `--sandbox`),
  stderr secret redaction, and per-session log cleanup. Output is plain text (agy
  has no structured output mode as of 1.0.16), so token counts are estimated.
  New registry models: `gemini-3.5-flash` (alias `agy-flash`) and `gemini-3.1-pro`
  (alias `agy-pro`); agy-proxied Claude/GPT-OSS models pass through unregistered.
  Behavior change: bare `gemini-3.5-flash` / `gemini-3.1-pro` now route to
  `engine: 'agy'` and require the `agy` binary; use the preview Gemini CLI slugs
  (`gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) for the `gemini` engine.
  Unknown model slugs silently fall back to agy's default (verified on 1.0.16).
  `AGY_BIN` env var overrides the binary. Verified against `agy` 1.0.16, including
  a live two-turn resume test.

- **`manual` permission mode** accepted everywhere `permissionMode` is (Claude Code CLI
  2.1.200 renamed the `default` mode to `manual`; both are accepted and equivalent).
  The agy and gemini engines map `manual` like `default` (→ `--sandbox`).
- **GPT-5.6 family registered** (limited preview, API/Codex only): `gpt-5.6-sol`
  ($5/$30 per Mtok, 1M context), `gpt-5.6-terra` ($2.50/$15, 1M), `gpt-5.6-luna`
  ($1/$6, 400K) — official OpenAI pricing-page ids and rates. The Codex default
  stays `gpt-5.5`: ChatGPT-account Codex auth does not serve GPT-5.6 (the API
  rejects it for that auth type), so 5.6 is opt-in via `model`.

### Changed

- **stderr secret redaction unified across engines** (`src/sanitize.ts`). The claude,
  gemini, cursor, opencode, custom, and agy engines now share one sanitizer whose
  patterns are the union of the previous per-engine copies (Bearer tokens incl.
  dotted `ya29.*`, `sk-*` keys, `api_key` assignments, and any `*_KEY=` / `*_TOKEN=` /
  `*_SECRET=` env var) — strictly broader redaction for every engine.
- Tested-engine pins updated to Claude Code **2.1.206** and Codex **0.143.0**. Both
  ranges since the last pins are reliability/TUI work that does not touch our
  invocation flags or output schemas; Codex `-c model_reasoning_effort=max` was
  re-tested against 0.143.0 and is still rejected for gpt-5.5 (0.143's first-class
  `max` applies to Bedrock GPT-5.6 models only), so the `max`→`xhigh` mapping stays.

### Removed

- `delegate` removed from `PermissionMode` and the tool schemas: current Claude Code
  CLIs reject it at spawn (verified against 2.1.206), so it could only produce a
  session that fails to start.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Claude Fable 5** registered in the model registry (`src/models.ts`): the first Claude 5-family
  model, in a tier above Opus. Standard $10/$50-per-Mtok pricing (cache read $1.00), full 1M-token
  context at standard rates (no long-context surcharge). New `fable` alias resolves to it. (Claude
  Mythos 5 is the same model at the same price but limited-availability, so it is not listed;
  `mythos`-named model strings are still routed to Anthropic.)

### Changed

- Anthropic-model detection heuristics (`isClaudeModel`, `resolveProvider` fallback) now recognize
  `fable` and `mythos` model strings.
- Tested Claude Code CLI pin updated to **2.1.199** (2.1.198–199 are subagent/background-agent
  reliability fixes — no invocation-surface change; Codex unchanged at 0.142.4).

## [4.5.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- CI now publishes to npm via **trusted publishing (OIDC)** instead of a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN`
  secret — no credential to rotate and nothing that expires. No change to the published package
  contents or runtime behavior.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Claude Sonnet 5** registered in the model registry (`src/models.ts`): native 1M-token context
  window, standard $3/$15-per-Mtok pricing (cached $0.30). It is the new Claude Code default as of
  CLI 2.1.197. (Anthropic runs a launch promo of $2/$10 through 2026-08-31; we price the standard
  rate so cost estimates never under-report.)

### Changed

- The `sonnet` alias now resolves to `claude-sonnet-5` (was `claude-sonnet-4-6`), matching the Claude
  CLI's own `sonnet` default so cost tracking and context-window estimates stay accurate. The older
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` remains selectable by its full id.
- **`gpt-5.5`** pricing and context window corrected to OpenAI's published values ($5/$30 per Mtok,
  cached $0.50, 1M-token context; previously a placeholder copied from `gpt-5.4`). Docs and examples
  now show `gpt-5.5` as the default Codex model.
- Tested-engine pins updated to Claude Code **2.1.197** and Codex **0.142.4**. Both ranges since the
  last pins (CC 2.1.179→2.1.197, Codex 0.138→0.142.x) are bug-fix / TUI / subsystem work that does
  not touch our invocation flags or the stream-json / codex-exec event schema — verified
  wire-compatible, no wrapper change.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-06-18

Reliability and robustness pass across every subsystem (from a full multi-lens code audit).
No behavior changes for normal use; the focus is failure-path correctness, resource cleanup,
and input validation. All 802 unit tests pass; build/lint/format clean.

### Fixed

- **Subprocess I/O (all engines):** `persistent-session` / `persistent-custom-session` now attach a
  readline `error` handler (an stdout stream fault used to crash the monitor process), check
  `stdin.writable` and pass a write error callback (silent write failures left `waitForComplete`
  callers hung), and clear references on process `error`. Force-kill (`SIGKILL`) fallback timers are
  `unref`'d so they can't block process exit.
- **SessionManager lifecycle:** `shutdown()` now clears the council / fan-out / ultraplan / ultrareview
  cleanup timers (their 30-min closures captured `this` and fired post-shutdown; council timers also
  blocked clean exit). `councilAbort` clears its own timer. Re-check session existence in `sendMessage`
  after the per-session queue await (TOCTOU vs `stopSession`). User stream callbacks are isolated so a
  throwing callback can't corrupt a turn. `autoloopDelete` is fenced against concurrent start/chat.
- **autoloop:** bounded `pausedBuffer` (unbounded growth during a long pause could OOM); `terminated`
  is now a true final state (queue is drained, no further messages dispatched); `sendWithRecovery`
  waits with jitter before its retry; push-policy updates validate rule field types; sandbox cleanup
  errors are surfaced; envelope deserialization fully validates routing; git-commit failures surface
  via `planner_error` instead of a silent warning.
- **council:** worktrees are cleaned up on abort and on run error (previously orphaned on disk;
  successful runs still keep them for the review flow).
- **inbox (cross-session messaging):** a broadcast (`to: '*'`) shared one message object across all
  recipients, so delivering it to an idle session marked the queued copy for busy recipients as
  already-read and `deliverInbox` then dropped it — each recipient now gets an independent copy.
- **ultraapp patcher:** snapshot restore writes each file atomically (temp + rename) and is
  idempotent, so an interrupted rollback can't leave a half-written file.
- **embedded server:** SSE writes are guarded against write-after-close; `close()` drains with a
  timeout instead of hanging on open SSE connections; the rate-limit timer is cleared on start
  failure; the server reference is cleared after close.
- **proxy / OpenAI-compat:** null/scalar tool-call arguments are normalized to objects; `tool_choice`
  maps `any→required` and handles `none`; usage falls back to a length-based estimate when live stats
  are unavailable.
- **ultraapp:** build-output capture is capped (runaway output could OOM); the on-failure fixer frames
  command output as untrusted data; snapshot/restore handles binary files as bytes (rollback used to
  delete them).
- **engines:** opencode fallback-text accumulation key fixed; `_isKnownCliProcess` matches CLI names at
  executable/path position (no longer matches hyphenated lookalikes).
- **Input validation:** `codex_review` base/commit refs are validated; array tool params
  (`agents`, `sanitizePatterns`, `allowedTools`/`disallowedTools`) have size caps.
- **Custom engine:** user-supplied `sanitizePatterns` compile via RE2 (linear-time) and invalid
  patterns are logged instead of silently dropped; non-JSON stdout is sanitized before logging.
- **Dependencies:** refreshed the lockfile (advisory count 30 → 5, none high/critical).

### Added

- `AutoloopConfig.maxDispatchDepth` — configurable per-drain message ceiling (default 64) for
  legitimately deep workflows.

### Docs

- Corrected the registered-tool count (39 → 63) and the documented opencode/cursor invocation flags
  to match the actual wrappers.

### Tests

- Added InboxManager coverage (idle/busy delivery, broadcast, queue flush, error fallback) and
  `getAnthropicBaseUrl` env-layer/memoization coverage; plus a regression test for the autoloop
  terminated final-state contract.

### Notes

- The remaining audit-reported dependency advisories (esbuild, and protobufjs/tar nested under the
  `openclaw` peer dependency) are not present in this package's published tarball; the only `npm audit
fix --force` path downgrades the `openclaw` peer to a stub, so it is intentionally not applied.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-06-16

Parity batch 2 + upgrades to the older subsystems now that the new `fanout` primitive exists.
Local-only by design — no cloud/managed features (`codex cloud exec`, best-of-N) since
decoupling from the machine loses local monitoring/control. Every flag/RPC verified against the
installed binaries.

### Added

- **`--fallback-model` array form.** `fallbackModel` on `session_start` now accepts a string or
  an array; arrays are joined into the comma-separated list the CLI tries in order.
- **`codex_threads` tool** (codex-app) — `thread/list` with optional filters/pagination
  (searchTerm/cwd/archived/cursor/limit); returns `{ data, nextCursor }`.
- **codex-app `thread/resume` on start.** When `resumeSessionId` is set, a codex-app session
  resumes the existing thread (`thread/resume`) instead of opening a fresh one.
- **Council per-agent `effort` + `ultracode`.** `AgentPersona` (and the `council_start` agent
  schema) gain `effort` and `ultracode`, passed through to each agent's session.
- **Cross-engine `ultrareview`.** `ultrareview_start` gains an `engines` option; reviewers now
  fan out (via the `fanout` primitive) across the requested engines (default `["claude"]`,
  round-robin), with per-agent failure isolation and a synthesis pass for `findings`.

### Changed

- **ultrareview now uses fan-out instead of a council** (single-shot N-perspective review +
  synthesis fits review better than consensus rounds). `UltrareviewResult` shape is unchanged;
  `councilId` now carries the fan-out run id.
- **Consensus observability.** `council` logs when an agent's vote came from a loose variant or
  was absent (`parseConsensusWithSource`), so degraded detection is visible. No behavior change.

### Fixed

- ultrareview reviewers run read-only (`plan` mode) — fan-out shares the project dir (no
  per-reviewer worktree like council had), so reviewers must analyse without editing the code
  under review.
- codex-app `thread/resume` on start degrades to `thread/start` if the thread id is stale/unknown,
  instead of failing the session.
- `ultrareviewStart` surfaces a failed fan-out launch as `status: 'error'` instead of leaving the
  result stuck at `'running'`.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-06-16

Parity pass for Claude Code 2.1.178 and Codex 0.137.0. Every upstream flag/method below was
verified against the installed binaries (several were absent despite being widely reported —
`--effort ultracode`, `codex exec --include-plan-tool`/`--ask-for-approval`, and
`claude continue/respawn/stop/logs` do not exist).

### Added

- **`ultracode` option on `session_start` (Claude engine).** Enables Claude Code's dynamic
  workflows: Claude plans a JS orchestration script per substantive task and fans out to
  subagents. Wired as the `ultracode: true` settings key merged into `--settings` (verified to
  activate workflows in headless `stream-json` mode); it is **not** a `--effort` value — the CLI
  rejects `--effort ultracode`. User-supplied `settings` (inline JSON or file path) are merged,
  never dropped.
- **Codex app-server v2 RPC tools** (`codex-app` engine): `codex_interrupt` (`turn/interrupt`),
  `codex_steer` (`turn/steer`, falls back to a normal turn when idle), `codex_fork`
  (`thread/fork`), `codex_rollback` (`thread/rollback`), `codex_models` (`model/list`). Param
  shapes verified against `codex app-server generate-json-schema`.
- **`claude_agents_list` tool** — wraps `claude agents --json` to list Claude Code background
  agent sessions (state/model/title/progress), with `all`/`cwd` filters.
- **Fan-out** (`fanout_start` / `fanout_status` / `fanout_abort`) — run one task across N
  engine/model agents in parallel and collect their answers, with an optional synthesis pass.
  The cross-engine best-of-N / diverse-perspective primitive; no rounds, votes, or worktrees
  (use `council` for isolated parallel edits).
- **Codex reasoning-effort passthrough.** The engine-agnostic `effort` is mapped to
  `codex exec -c model_reasoning_effort=<level>` (`max`→`xhigh`; `auto`/`ultracode` omitted),
  verified accepted by Codex 0.137 under `--strict-config`.
- **Codex `codexProfile` option** on `session_start` → `codex exec --profile <name>` (named
  config profile from `~/.codex/config.toml`).

### Changed

- **Codex `item.completed` parsing.** `reasoning` and `todo_list` items are now logged as
  reasoning/plan output instead of being miscounted as tool calls; real tool items
  (`command_execution`, `file_change`, `mcp_tool_call`, `web_search`) increment `toolCalls`, and
  a `command_execution` with a non-zero `exit_code` increments `toolErrors`.
- **Codex app-server turn failures** (`turn/completed` with `status: 'failed'`) now reject the
  turn and increment `toolErrors`, matching the `codex exec` wrapper, instead of resolving an
  empty turn.

### Fixed

- `codex exec --profile` is now only sent on the first turn — `codex exec resume` rejects it
  (verified against `codex exec resume --help` on 0.137; `-c` and `--model` are accepted there).
- The codex-app active turn id is cleared on `turn/completed`, so `codex_interrupt`/`codex_steer`
  can no longer target an already-finished turn.
- `fanout_start` validates agent-name uniqueness (names form session names) and exposes
  `synthesisError` so a failed synthesis pass is distinguishable from one that was not requested.
  Tool schemas hardened (`codex_rollback.numTurns` minimum, fan-out agent `name`/`synthesisEngine`).

### Tracked

- Engine CLI reference bumped to tested versions Claude Code **2.1.178** and Codex **0.137.0**.

## [4.1.2] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Opus 4.8 / 4.7 in the model registry.** `claude-opus-4-8` (now the `opus`
  alias target) and `claude-opus-4-7` are registered in `src/models.ts` with
  pricing and context window, so model resolution and cost reporting are correct
  when sessions request `opus` or pin a specific Opus 4.x id. Previously `opus`
  resolved to `claude-opus-4-6`. `claude-opus-4-6` remains available by id.

### Fixed

- **Codex turn failures are now surfaced instead of resolving empty.** The Codex
  wrapper now handles `turn.failed` and `error` stream events and rejects the
  send with the reported message, even when the process exits 0. Previously a
  failed turn fell through to the log channel and resolved an empty string,
  silently masking the error.

### Changed

- Synced tested versions to Claude Code CLI 2.1.161 (from 2.1.150). The
  2.1.151–2.1.161 range is mostly TUI / reliability work; two fixes directly
  benefit our spawn path (2.1.153 stream-json stdin-close hang, 2.1.161 `-p`
  stdout corruption from background subagents) with no wrapper change required.
  Codex remains at 0.133.0.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Codex structured output via `jsonSchema`.** The existing engine-agnostic
  `jsonSchema` session config now wires into the Codex engine: it is written to
  a temp file and passed as `codex exec --output-schema <FILE>` (and on resume),
  enforcing the model's final response shape. Previously `jsonSchema` only
  applied to the Claude engine (`--json-schema`). Requires Codex 0.132+.
- **Antigravity CLI (`agy`) custom-engine recipe.** Documented a ready-to-use
  `CustomEngineConfig` for Google's `agy` in `multi-engine.md`, so it can be
  driven today via `engine: 'custom'`. Note: `agy` 1.0.2 has no structured
  output mode, so token counts are estimated.

### Fixed

- **Gemini engine: pass `--skip-trust`.** Gemini CLI 0.43 added a "trusted
  folders" gate that aborts headless `-p` runs in untrusted directories
  (worktrees, arbitrary cwds) before any output is produced. The wrapper now
  always passes `--skip-trust`, restoring headless operation.

### Changed

- Bumped tested engine CLI versions: Claude Code `2.1.150`, Codex `0.133.0`,
  Gemini `0.43.0`. All wrappers re-verified against their pinned invocations.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Sync to Claude Code CLI 2.1.140

Catches up on programmatic surface between Claude CLI 2.1.126 and 2.1.140.

- **`claude_goal_set` / `claude_goal_clear` / `claude_goal_status`** tools wrap
  the CLI 2.1.139 `/goal` slash command. Claude Code keeps working across turns
  until the stated condition is met, evaluating after each turn via Haiku.
  The wrappers send the slash text via the existing session channel and enforce
  `engine: "claude"`; unlike Codex's `/goal`, there is no separate goal-state
  notification — the only surface is the assistant's reply text.

- **`plugin_details`** tool wraps `claude plugin details <name>` (CLI 2.1.139+).
  Returns the plugin's component inventory plus per-session token cost.

- **`pluginUrl`** session config maps to `--plugin-url` (CLI 2.1.129+). Accepts a
  single URL or an array; each value is fetched as a plugin `.zip` archive for
  the session.

Items intentionally not exposed at the wrapper level: settings.json fields
(`worktree.baseRef`, `autoMode.hard_deny`, `skillOverrides`, `sandbox.bwrapPath`
/ `socatPath`, `parentSettingsBehavior`) are already user-controlled via the
existing `--settings` flag; TTY-only env vars (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SYNC_OUTPUT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`) do not apply to a
non-interactive subprocess; hook config (`args: string[]` exec form,
`continueOnBlock`, hook input `effort.level`) and the subagent
`x-claude-code-agent-id` HTTP header are internal to the CLI.

## [4.0.7] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — CI flake in manager.test.ts (ENOTEMPTY during afterEach)

The "setModeForDelta + interview-complete auto-fires startBuild" case
let `startBuild` actually spawn a real council subprocess + git worktree,
then dropped back to the polling loop as soon as mode hit `queued`. By
the time `afterEach` ran `fs.rmSync(tmp, recursive)`, the council git
workers were still writing into `<tmp>/council-project/.git`, racing the
recursive removal and surfacing as `ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty,
rmdir '.git'`.

The test's contract is the interview-complete → startBuild handoff —
nothing about the build pipeline's downstream behaviour. Now mocks
`runCouncilSynth` and `runFixOnFailure` so the build short-circuits
without spawning external workers. Local stress (20× consecutive runs)
passes cleanly.

## [4.0.6] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — `UltraappStore` JSON files now written atomically

`UltraappStore.setMode` / `writeSpec` / `recordBuildArtifact` /
`recordDeploy` / `createRun` all used `fsp.writeFile`, whose
truncate-then-stream sequence leaves a window where a concurrent reader
sees a partial file. The manager test's polling loop tripped on this in
CI (`Expected ',' or '}' after property value in JSON at position 148`
inside `readState`); the race exists in production too — any code that
polls run state while another path mutates it can read the partial
write.

Added `atomicWriteJson(file, body)` that writes to
`<file>.tmp.<pid>.<rand>` and `rename(2)`s onto the target. POSIX
rename is atomic, so concurrent readers see the old file or the new
one, never the gap. All seven writer sites in `store.ts` route through
the helper.

## [4.0.5] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Coder / Reviewer panes were blank after refresh

4.0.4 added `chat.jsonl` persistence for the Planner conversation but the
Coder and Reviewer replies stayed SSE-only. The result: opening a run
after a refresh / cross-process / Resume showed the Planner thread
populated but the Coder and Reviewer panes empty until the next SSE
event arrived — and for terminated runs, no SSE events ever come.

- `dispatcher.deliverToCoder` and `dispatcher.deliverToReviewer` now
  append every reply to `<ledger>/chat.jsonl` alongside the existing
  `emit('coder_reply' | 'reviewer_reply', ...)` calls.
- Each phase also writes a heartbeat entry the moment delivery starts:
  `🔨 Coder iter N working…` / `🔍 Reviewer iter N auditing…`. Useful
  for liveness checks on long turns (the dashboard sees activity even
  before the agent produces output) and survives refresh because it's
  on disk.
- `appendChatEntry`'s `who` union widened to include `coder` and
  `reviewer`.
- The dashboard's `chat_history` hydration now routes entries by `who`
  into the corresponding pane (`coder` → Coder pane, `reviewer` →
  Reviewer pane, others → Planner pane), so refreshing a mid-iter run
  shows the complete three-way conversation.

## [4.0.4] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Auth token now read per-request from disk

4.0.3 read the token file once at server start. If another `clawo serve`
instance (a nohup test, a second launchd service) briefly held the bind
and wrote a different token before losing, the live server's in-memory
token would diverge from the file. sasha-doctor's reverse proxy reads the
file fresh on every request, so the proxy-injected `Bearer` no longer
matched the server's check — manifesting as 401 with the
"Send Authorization: Bearer <token>" hint despite the file being right.
Each request now re-reads `~/.openclaw/server-token` (a 64-byte read from
kernel page cache, microsecond cost on this endpoint) so the in-memory
token and file value can never permanently diverge. `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN`
env override and the `disabled` opt-out are unchanged.

### Fixed — Reopening a terminated autoloop run no longer hangs on "Waiting…"

`autoloopStatus(runId)` previously returned `undefined` for any run that
wasn't in this process's in-memory map, so the dashboard's `/autoloop/<id>/state`
fetch 404'd on every terminated run and the UI stayed on its "Waiting…"
placeholder forever. `autoloopStatus` now falls back to
`listAutoloopsFromRegistry` and reconstructs a `terminated`-state shape
from the on-disk ledger when there's no live runner. `/push_log` was
refactored to go through `autoloopStatus` so it benefits from the same
fallback. `/events` returns a single-shot SSE (snapshot + `terminated`
event + close) for disk-only runs so the dashboard's existing handlers
cleanly render history without crashing on a 404 EventSource.

### Added — Chat history persistence + `/autoloop/<id>/chat_history` endpoint

Planner user-messages and Planner replies are now appended to
`<ledger>/chat.jsonl` on every turn. The dashboard fetches this file on
open and replays the conversation into the planner pane, so refreshing
the page / re-opening a terminated run / coming back from a `clawo serve`
restart no longer wipes the visible history. Returns `[]` for runs that
predate this change.

### Added — `POST /autoloop/<id>/resume` + Resume button

Terminated runs can now be brought back in-process. The endpoint:

1. Looks up the run in `~/.claw-orchestrator/autoloop-registry.jsonl`.
2. Re-creates the runner + dispatcher with the same `run_id` / workspace.
3. `ensurePlanner` picks up the Planner's `claudeSessionId` from
   `persistedSessions` (now kept on disk because `dispatcher.shutdown`
   passes `keepPersisted: true` to `stopSession`) and Claude resumes the
   original conversation. Runs that predate this change have no persisted
   session — they get a fresh Planner with the same system prompt, while
   the dashboard replays `chat.jsonl` (when present) visually.

The dashboard surfaces a green **Resume run** button in the top bar
whenever a run's status is `terminated`. Click → POST `/resume` →
reconnect SSE.

### Changed — `SessionManager.stopSession(name, { keepPersisted? })`

`stopSession` now accepts an opts bag. `keepPersisted: true` keeps the
`persistedSessions` entry on disk so a later resume can re-attach the
Claude session. Defaults to the old behaviour (entry deleted) so callers
that haven't opted in are unaffected. Autoloop `dispatcher.shutdown(...)`
passes `keepPersisted: true` automatically; `autoloopDelete` passes
`purge: true` to ensure a real delete still scrubs everything.

## [4.0.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Dashboard auth token survives `clawo serve` restarts

`EmbeddedServer` regenerated the auth token from `crypto.randomBytes` on every
construction, ignoring the on-disk `~/.openclaw/server-token`. Every server
restart therefore invalidated the browser cookie / open dashboard tabs / any
running CLI session — users had to re-login through `/login?token=…` after
each restart. The server now reads the persisted token first (validated as
≥32 hex chars), falling back to fresh generation only when the file is
missing or malformed. The `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN` env override and the
`disabled` opt-out still take precedence. The token file remains mode 0600.

### Fixed — `session-pids.json` no longer accumulates stale entries

`SessionManager._savePids()`'s read-merge-write logic unconditionally
preserved entries from owners other than the current process, even after
the owning `SessionManager` had exited. The actual child processes those
entries tracked were already reaped by `_cleanupOrphanedPids()` at the
next server start, so this was a bookkeeping leak rather than a process
leak — but the file grew monotonically across restarts. `_savePids()` now
probes `process.kill(ownerPid, 0)` before keeping an other-owner entry;
dead-owner rows are dropped. An additional unit test
(`session-manager-pidfile.test.ts`) locks down the new behaviour and the
existing "merges instead of overwriting" test was updated to use
`process.ppid` as a guaranteed-live other owner so it actually exercises
the live-owner code path.

### Changed — Planner is now physically prevented from authoring content files

The Planner is meant to design plans and delegate; the Coder is meant to
produce deliverables. In practice the Planner happily wrote LaTeX files /
docs / code itself the moment a user asked, because:

1. Its Claude Code session had the full Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit
   palette enabled.
2. The "don't author files" rule lived ~120 lines deep in the system
   prompt, mixed with style notes — soft enough that direct user
   instruction overrode it.
3. The plan.md / goal.json authoring path used Write + a separate commit
   tool, so the same Write tool that authored deliverables also authored
   plans. No mechanical way to allow one and forbid the other.

The fix moves the role boundary from soft (prompt rule) to hard
(tool gating):

- **Planner session now passes `disallowedTools: ['Write', 'Edit',
'MultiEdit', 'NotebookEdit']` to Claude Code.** Read / Glob / Grep /
  Bash stay enabled so the Planner can still discover and audit the
  workspace.
- **New autoloop tools `write_plan` and `write_goal`** replace
  `write_plan_committed` / `write_goal_committed`. They take the full
  file `content` as a string + an optional `commit_message`. The
  orchestrator writes the file server-side, then commits. This is the
  Planner's **only** legitimate path to author plan.md / goal.json.
  `write_goal` parses `content` as JSON before writing and errors back
  to the Planner on parse failure.
- **All three system prompts (Planner / Coder / Reviewer) rewritten** to
  put hard rules at the top under an `# ABSOLUTE RULES` heading, with a
  worked good/bad example for the Planner. Coder and Reviewer prompts
  got the same structural treatment for self-consistency, though their
  boundaries remain prompt-only (their roles need Write/Edit to function;
  Reviewer's cwd-isolation continues to provide soft sandboxing).
- `PlannerToolEffects.commitPlanFile` renamed to `writePlanFile(file,
content, commitMessage?)` — the new contract takes content.

This is a behavioural breaking change for anyone driving the Planner with
custom prompts that reference the old tool names; the orchestrator surfaces
"unknown tool" warnings if it sees them.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — `POST /autoloop/<id>/chat` 524 timeout behind a reverse proxy

4.0.1's chat route awaited the Planner's reply inline and returned it in the
HTTP body. First-contact replies on a freshly-spawned Planner routinely take
30–120s, which exceeds the Cloudflare Tunnel origin idle limit and surfaces as
a 524 in the dashboard. The user's textarea also didn't clear because the
fetch resolved into the error branch.

- HTTP `POST /autoloop/<id>/chat` is now fire-and-forget: validates the run
  is alive in memory, dispatches the message, returns **202** `{ ok, queued:
true }` immediately. The Planner's reply streams back via `/events` as a
  `planner_reply` event — the dashboard already subscribes to it.
- New `planner_error` SSE event so runtime failures inside the Planner
  surface to the dashboard instead of hanging the "thinking…" indicator.
- Dashboard clears the textarea on send, shows a `pending` "Planner is
  thinking…" placeholder, and removes it when `planner_reply` or
  `planner_error` arrives.
- The MCP `autoloop_chat` tool path is unchanged — it still awaits and
  returns the reply, since it runs in-process and isn't subject to
  reverse-proxy idle limits.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed — Autoloop chat in the dashboard

The dashboard's Planner compose box posted to `/v1/openclaw/tools/autoloop_chat`,
which only exists as an MCP tool in the OpenClaw plugin surface — not as an
embedded-server HTTP route. The request 404'd silently (fetch resolves on 4xx
without throwing), the input cleared, and the user saw their message disappear
with no Planner reply.

- Added `POST /autoloop/<id>/chat` to embedded-server, wired to
  `SessionManager.autoloopChat()`. Returns `{ ok, reply }`; the reply also
  streams through `/events` as a `planner_reply` SSE event.
- Dashboard now hits the new route, checks `response.ok`, and renders
  `[error] …` into the planner log on failure instead of swallowing it.
- 400 on empty `text`, 404 when the run is unknown.

### Added — Delete an autoloop run from the dashboard

Failed or completed runs piled up in the sidebar with no way to remove them.

- New `POST /autoloop/<id>/delete` endpoint and
  `SessionManager.autoloopDelete()`. Stops the runner if alive, scrubs the
  row from `~/.claw-orchestrator/autoloop-registry.jsonl`. The ledger
  directory under `<workspace>/tasks/<run_id>/` is intentionally kept on
  disk for postmortem inspection.
- Dashboard run list shows a hover-revealed **Delete** button on each
  autoloop row, with a confirmation prompt. After deletion the detail
  pane resets to the empty state if the deleted run was open.
- New helper `removeAutoloopFromRegistry(file, run_id)` exported from
  `session-manager.ts`, with idempotent semantics and an atomic
  write-temp-then-rename.

### Tests

- `disk-enum.test.ts`: three new cases covering the registry scrub
  (multi-line drop, absent run_id, missing file).
- `embedded-server-launcher.test.ts`: two new suites covering the new
  chat (200 / 400 / 404) and delete (200 / 404) routes against a stubbed
  manager.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — ultraapp (Forge tab)

A new dashboard tab and a 14-tool MCP surface that turns a structured Q&A
interview into a deployed web app reachable at `localhost:19000/forge/<slug>/`,
with a post-deploy feedback loop and a reference-trace regression harness.

Roughly: open Forge → answer 5–8 questions (each with a recommended option) →
click Start Build → council writes a complete codebase, fix-on-failure drives
`npm install && npm run build && npm test && docker build .` to green, deploy
registers the slug → share-card URL appears in chat. Iterate via chat:
"make button green" → cosmetic patcher; "also output a thumbnail" →
spec-delta focused interview + auto-rerun. Versions tagged `v1`, `v2`, ...
and switchable via Promote.

#### Pipeline

- **Interview engine** (`src/ultraapp/interview-parser.ts`,
  `src/ultraapp/interview-tools.ts`): structured Q&A envelopes with
  recommended option, free-form fallback, contextual citations.
  `update_spec` (RFC 6902 JSON Patch), `extract_metadata` (file probe /
  ffprobe), `check_completeness` tool calls. Mid-reply tool-call + question
  bundling supported.
- **Council super-task** (`src/ultraapp/council-adapter.ts`): three Claude
  Opus agents in fresh git worktrees of a per-run project dir reach
  consensus by 3-way YES vote (uses the existing `Council` class).
- **Fix-on-failure helper** (`src/ultraapp/fix-on-failure.ts`): purpose-
  built ~50-line loop that drives `npm install / build / test / docker
build` and spawns a Claude Opus fixer session on red, up to N rounds.
  Replaces the original autoloop adapter (different problem shape).
- **Build queue** (`src/ultraapp/build.ts`): global serial FIFO with 11
  `BuildEvent` variants and live position reporting.
- **Deploy + reverse-proxy router** (`src/ultraapp/deploy.ts`,
  `src/ultraapp/router.ts`, `src/ultraapp/lifecycle.ts`,
  `src/ultraapp/host-strategy.ts`, `src/ultraapp/docker.ts`): two
  runtime modes — `host` (default) spawns the generated app as a
  regular Node process (zero extra deps; works anywhere Node works),
  `docker` (opt-in via `clawo serve --ultraapp-runtime docker`) uses
  `docker build` + `docker run -d --restart unless-stopped` for shared-
  host isolation. Both allocate a dynamic port in `[19100, 19999]`.
  Node-only reverse proxy at port 19000 (with port-fallback) maps
  `/forge/<slug>/*` to backends; slug map persists to `_router.json`
  for survival across orchestrator restarts. Host-mode pid metadata
  persists to `~/.claw-orchestrator/host-procs.json` so start/stop
  survive orchestrator restarts the same way.
- **Narrator** (`src/ultraapp/narrator.ts`): per-run Claude Haiku session
  batches build events (every 6 / 15s / urgent) and writes short
  conversational chat updates instead of raw event lines. Language
  auto-detected (Chinese / English) from prior interview chat. Falls
  back to raw lines if Haiku is unavailable.
- **Done-mode feedback loop** (`src/ultraapp/feedback-classifier.ts`,
  `src/ultraapp/patcher.ts`, `src/ultraapp/spec-delta.ts`,
  `src/ultraapp/versions.ts`, `src/ultraapp/diff-apply.ts`): post-deploy
  chat is classified by Haiku into cosmetic / spec-delta / structural and
  routed: cosmetic → Opus patcher (unified diff + apply + validate +
  auto-revert + version snapshot); spec-delta → focused interview
  bootstrap + auto-rerun on completion; structural → suggest fresh run.
  Versions snapshot to `versions/vN/` and swap atomically via the router.

#### Surface

- **MCP tools (14):** `ultraapp_list`, `ultraapp_get`, `ultraapp_status`,
  `ultraapp_new`, `ultraapp_answer`, `ultraapp_add_file`,
  `ultraapp_spec_edit`, `ultraapp_build_start`, `ultraapp_build_cancel`,
  `ultraapp_feedback`, `ultraapp_promote_version`,
  `ultraapp_start_container`, `ultraapp_stop_container`, `ultraapp_delete`.
  All declared in `openclaw.plugin.json`.
- **HTTP routes:** `/ultraapp/{list, new, <id>, <id>/answer,
<id>/spec-edit, <id>/files, <id>/events (SSE), <id>/build,
<id>/build/cancel, <id>/artifacts, <id>/start, <id>/stop, <id>/delete,
<id>/feedback, <id>/promote-version}`.
- **Dashboard:** Forge tab with three-column layout (chat / spec / files).
  Mode pill (interview → queued → building → build-complete | deploying →
  done | failed). Chat input mode-aware: in interview mode submits to
  `/answer`; in done mode submits to `/feedback`. Versions panel in the
  AppSpec column with per-version Promote button. Sidebar lifecycle
  buttons (start / stop / delete). `Make Public…` modal with
  Cloudflare Tunnel / ngrok / Tailscale / Caddy snippets.

#### Reference traces

5 JSONL traces of real interviews (text-summariser, image-batch-resize,
vlog-cut, llm-agent-pipeline, branching-dag) under
`src/__tests__/fixtures/ultraapp-traces/`. Each pairs with a frozen
`expected/<name>.appspec.json` snapshot. The
`spec-extraction-quality.test.ts` test replays each trace through the
interview engine and asserts the resulting AppSpec matches — any future
engine or skill drift fails this test loudly. Manual smoke runner at
`scripts/test-ultraapp-integration.ts`.

#### Skill + reference docs

- **`skills/ultraapp/SKILL.md`** — interview behavioural contract +
  question-envelope schema + tool-call contract + ending criteria. Refined
  based on real-trace findings: tool-call + question in the same reply
  is the encouraged pattern; stop-early guidance to avoid over-asking
  (typical complete spec lands in 5–8 questions).
- **`skills/references/ultraapp.md`** (new) — operator reference: lifecycle,
  conventions §1–§7 summary, runtime modes, file layout, all 14 MCP tools
  - matching HTTP routes, done-mode classifier behaviour, reference-trace
    replayer, known limitations.
- **`skills/references/tools.md`** — adds Autoloop (6) and Ultraapp (14)
  sections with full param schemas; total declared tool count now matches
  the 55 registered in `src/index.ts`.
- **`skills/SKILL.md`** + **`skills/claw-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** —
  description and trigger keywords now include ultraapp / Forge tab /
  AppSpec / one-click app, and tool counts updated from 35/41 to 55.

#### Runtime dep

- New: `diff` (BSD-2; powers the patcher's unified-diff applier).

### Fixed

- **Interview parser tools+question dropping** (`interview-parser.ts`):
  when Claude returned `<tool name=...>` calls AND a fenced \`\`\`question
  block in a single reply, the parser used to return kind `'tools'` and
  silently drop the question. The follow-up tool_result driveTurn would
  get a free-text reply ("Waiting on the X question above.") and the
  interview would stall. Now returns a `'tools-and-question'` kind; the
  manager runs the tools, surfaces the question to the user immediately,
  and fires the tool_result follow-up in the background.
- **Spec validator over-strictness** (`spec.ts`, `store.ts`,
  `manager.ts`): `validateAppSpec` ran on every `writeSpec`, meaning
  every intermediate `update_spec` patch had to pass full cross-ref +
  DAG checks. But Claude builds the spec incrementally; transient
  invalid states (a step refs an undeclared input) are normal mid-
  interview but were rejected, leaving Claude to retry-loop and punt the
  pipeline (`spec.pipeline.steps` stayed `[]` for non-trivial captures).
  Split into `validateAppSpecShape` (lax: version + runId + name regex;
  called from `writeSpec`) and `validateAppSpec` (strict: shape +
  cross-refs + DAG; called from `startBuild` before enqueueing). Build
  no longer starts on an invalid spec.
- **PID-file cross-process safety** (`session-manager.ts`): the host-
  shared `~/.openclaw/session-pids.json` had no notion of which
  SessionManager process owned each entry. Two consequences: (1) every
  `_savePids` call overwrote the file, erasing other live managers'
  entries; (2) every `_cleanupOrphanedPids` constructor pass would kill
  any pid in the file whose process was alive AND looked like a coding
  CLI. Result: starting a fresh SessionManager (e.g., for a smoke test)
  killed the children of the existing gateway SessionManager. Now each
  entry is tagged with `{ pid, ownerPid, since }`; saves do read-merge-
  write keyed by ownerPid; cleanup skips entries whose ownerPid points
  to a live process. Legacy bare-number entries are conservatively
  skipped (no kill) and dropped on the next save.

### Added — frontend quality conventions (council §7)

- **`src/ultraapp/conventions.ts` §7 — Frontend quality (mandatory).**
  Adds a binding architectural section the council reads alongside the
  rest. Covers: styling system (Tailwind / shadcn / daisyUI / Mantine /
  Chakra / CSS Modules + tokens — pick one), layout & typography
  (centered max-width, real type hierarchy, ≥1.5 line-height, 375px
  responsive, real favicon), state coverage (empty / loading / error /
  success — all four explicit on every async surface, no raw "Loading…"
  or error JSON), form quality (labels above, drag-and-drop with
  previews, inline validation, disabled+spinner submit), result
  presentation (galleries / lightboxes for images, list-before-CTA for
  ZIPs), theme (one deliberate light / dark / toggle), and a §7g council
  frontend gate that every agent must execute before voting YES.
  "Functional minimum" is now a NO vote. Section 5 voting marker and
  agent-C persona updated to enforce.
- **§7g requires real Chrome-headless screenshots, not code review.**
  First live exercise of §7 produced a polished desktop but a
  mobile-overflow UI because agents inspected meta tags / @media
  queries instead of opening the rendered PNG. §7g now spells out the
  exact `chrome --headless=new --window-size=1440,900` and `375,812`
  invocations and requires agents to open the resulting PNGs and verify
  by eye — explicitly calling out that source-code review is
  insufficient evidence.

### Added — session-manager cross-process visibility

- **Council transcript enumerator** (`src/session-manager.ts`,
  `src/council.ts`): `listCouncilsFromDisk()` parses
  `~/.openclaw/council-logs/*.md` headers; `councilList()` unions
  in-memory sessions with the disk view (dedup by id, in-memory wins).
  Council transcripts now embed an `- **ID**: <id>` header line so
  reconstructed records can dedup reliably; legacy transcripts fall back
  to filename-derived id.
- **Autoloop registry** (`src/session-manager.ts`):
  `appendAutoloopRegistry()` / `listAutoloopsFromRegistry()` backed by
  append-only `~/.claw-orchestrator/autoloop-registry.jsonl`.
  `autoloopStart()` records each run; `autoloopList()` unions in-memory
  runs with registry entries (dedup, stale ledger_dirs filtered,
  newest-first). Together these give the dashboard cross-process
  visibility of past runs across plugin-side SessionManager and
  standalone `clawo serve`.

### Added — debug tooling

- `UA_DEBUG_TURNS=<dir>` env var: when set, `driveTurn` writes every
  turn's raw `(in, out)` pair to `<dir>/<runId>.turns.jsonl`. Off by
  default; production behavior unchanged. Used by trace-capture scripts
  to reconstruct full trace JSONL (incl. tool calls, which never appear
  in `chat.jsonl`).

### Added — Dashboard launchers + cross-process visibility

The dashboard is no longer read-only. Council and Autoloop tabs now have
"+ New" sidebar buttons that match the Forge tab pattern from the same
release:

- **`POST /council/new`** (`src/embedded-server.ts`): minimal body
  `{ task, projectDir, maxRounds? }`, wires to a 3-agent Claude Opus
  preset (planner / pragmatic implementer / critical reviewer). The
  existing `council_start` plugin tool remains the path for fully
  custom agent configurations.
- **`POST /autoloop/new`** (`src/embedded-server.ts`): minimal body
  `{ workspace, run_id?, planner_model?, send_timeout_ms? }`. `run_id`
  is generated server-side (`auto-<ts>-<rand>`) when missing or
  malformed; explicit well-shaped ids are honored.
- **Tab-aware modal launcher** (`src/dashboard/index.html`): one modal
  swaps visible fields by `state.tab`, submits to the right endpoint,
  selects the new run, refreshes the list, and opens the detail pane
  with SSE attached.
- **Empty-state CTA**: replaces the bland "Select a run to view" with
  "Start your first <X>" that triggers the same launcher. No more
  ambiguous fresh-install state.

Standalone deployment is now the documented setup. Run
`clawo serve --port 18796` under launchd (see
`skills/references/dashboard.md` for the plist template). It owns the
auth token; the OpenClaw gateway plugin keeps its lazy-init embedded
server but gracefully skips on EADDRINUSE.

Cross-process visibility for past runs:

- **`SessionManager.councilList()`** unions in-memory sessions with
  on-disk transcripts at `~/.openclaw/council-logs/*.md`, deduped by
  id (in-memory wins), sorted newest-first.
- **Autoloop registry** (new file
  `~/.claw-orchestrator/autoloop-registry.jsonl`): `autoloopStart()`
  appends one row per run; `autoloopList()` unions the registry with
  in-memory runs, drops stale entries whose ledger directory no longer
  exists.
- Council transcripts now include an `- **ID**: <session.id>` header
  line so disk-derived records dedup reliably against in-memory state.
  Legacy transcripts fall back to a filename-derived id.

### Fixed — embedded-server token-file race

`_writeTokenFile()` previously ran unconditionally during `start()`,
**before** `server.listen()`. When a second `EmbeddedServer` instance
lost the EADDRINUSE race it skipped listening but had already
overwritten `~/.openclaw/server-token` with a different value,
invalidating any cookies the winner had minted. The write now happens
inside the `listen()`-success callback, so only the process that
actually owns the port persists its token — required for the new
standalone-plus-plugin dual-process deployment to be safe.

### Added — `/login` redirect endpoint

`GET /login?token=<value>&redirect=/dash` validates the token, sets the
`HttpOnly clawo_auth` cookie, and 302s to the redirect target
(same-origin only). Browsers can bookmark `/dash` directly — the token
never appears in the bookmark URL, referrer headers, or CF logs.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- `/session/grep` and the `session-grep` tool now compile user-supplied patterns
  with [RE2](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2) instead of the V8 regex engine.
  RE2 evaluates regexes in linear time and never backtracks, so patterns like
  `(a+)+$` that previously could block the Node event loop now complete in
  microseconds. Closes #64. Thanks to @ybdesire for the report.
- Note: RE2 does not support a handful of PCRE-only features (lookbehind,
  backreferences). Patterns using those features will be rejected at compile
  time with an `Invalid regex pattern` error.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added — Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

- **`clawo-mcp` binary.** A stdio MCP server that re-exports the orchestrator's
  full toolset (41 tools — sessions, council, ultraplan, ultrareview, autoloop,
  codex, inbox) to any MCP-compatible host: Hermes Agent, Claude Desktop,
  Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, Zed, Windsurf, Goose, and others.
- **Shared tool definitions.** The MCP server captures the same tool
  registrations used by the OpenClaw plugin entry, so there is exactly one
  source of truth and zero schema drift between the two distribution forms.
- **Tool annotations.** Read-only, destructive, and open-world hints are
  advertised per tool so hosts can prefer safer tools during reasoning.
- **`CLAWO_MCP_TOOLS` env.** Comma-separated allowlist to keep the exposed
  surface tight when the host has a small tool budget.
- **`CLAWO_NO_EMBEDDED_SERVER` env.** Lets the plugin skip starting its HTTP
  control plane (port 18796) when running in pure MCP mode; `clawo-mcp` sets
  this automatically.
- New reference doc: [`skills/references/mcp.md`](./skills/references/mcp.md)
  with per-host configuration snippets and troubleshooting.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added — autoloop ergonomics & guardrails

- **Reviewer frozen-memory injection.** `reviewer_memory.md` is now read at
  Reviewer-session start and inlined as a `<frozen_memory_snapshot>` block in
  the system prompt. The snapshot stays constant for the session's lifetime,
  so the prefix cache hits on every iter; edits to the file on disk take
  effect on the next Reviewer reset.
- **Phase-error circuit breaker.** Consecutive `phase_error` messages
  (subprocess deaths, failed `git commit`, etc.) count toward a configurable
  threshold (`phaseErrorCircuit`, default `3`). When tripped, the runner
  emits a `decision`-level push and auto-terminates with reason
  `phase_error_circuit`. A successful `iter_done` resets the count.
- **Stall detection.** A wall-clock timer fires `on_stall_30min` when the
  runner has processed no messages for `stallMs` (default 30 min) while
  `status === 'running'`. Configurable via `stallMs` /
  `stallCheckIntervalMs`.
- **`decisions.jsonl` audit trail.** `terminate`, `reset_agent`,
  `update_push_policy`, `compact`, `spawn_subagents`, `phase_error`, and
  rejected silence attempts write structured entries to
  `<ledger>/decisions.jsonl`.
- **`prior_metrics` history.** Runner keeps the last 20 verdict metrics and
  passes the most recent 10 in every `review_request`, finally enabling the
  Reviewer rubric's "metric improved but eval unchanged" check.
- **Ledger `schema_version`.** `directive.json` / `eval_output.json` /
  `verdict.json` now carry `schema_version: 1` for forward-compatible
  migrations.

### Fixed — autoloop correctness

- **`state.iter` no longer pinned at `0`.** It advances by one per committed
  `review_verdict`, so SSE events, `iter_done` payloads, push summaries and
  ledger directories all point at the right iter. The dispatcher also bumps
  the iter passed into Planner-tool handlers when responding to an
  `iter_done(N)`, so follow-up directives correctly target iter `N+1`.
- **`pause_loop` is enforced.** Previously a no-op; the runner now parks
  agent-bound messages in a paused-buffer and replays them in order on
  `resume`. `terminate` / runner-bound messages still process while paused.
- **Coder / Reviewer subprocess death surfaces as `phase_error`.** A failed
  `sendWithRecovery` retry used to masquerade as a "clarification request",
  hiding the most common failure mode. A new `fatal` marker now flows into
  a `phase_error` envelope and feeds the circuit.
- **Reviewer sandbox restage preserves `reviewer_log.jsonl`.** The whitelist
  also keeps the append-only audit log the Reviewer prompt has always
  promised.
- **Git commit failure inside an iter** (hook reject, signing missing) is
  surfaced as `phase_error` instead of writing a stale `iter_artifacts`
  with a phantom diff.
- **Planner prompt drift.** Removed stale references to
  `src/autoloop/v1/types.ts` (file does not exist) and the "S2 has no
  `notify_user`" line that kept Planner from ever pushing the user.

### Changed

- **`update_push_policy` cannot silence `on_phase_error` or
  `on_decision_needed`.** The `silent` flag is stripped (other fields on
  the same rule still apply) and the attempt is recorded in
  `decisions.jsonl`. Prevents a confused Planner from muting the
  operator's lifeline channels.
- **`firePolicyPush` self-drains** when called outside an active drain
  (notably from the stall-detector interval), so policy pushes always
  reach the notifier.
- **`notify` reads recipient env vars at call time** rather than caching
  them at module load — operators can rotate the env without restarting.

### Tests

- New `src/__tests__/autoloop-dispatcher.test.ts` (7 tests) covering
  frozen-memory injection, phase_error surfacing, policy silencing guard,
  sandbox whitelist, auto-compact + decisions.jsonl, ledger schema_version.
- New `src/__tests__/autoloop-notify.test.ts` (5 tests) covering the
  fallback chain (wechat → whatsapp → email), env-var gating, webchat
  no-op, and `appendPushLog` formatting.
- Extended `src/__tests__/autoloop-runner.test.ts` (16 tests, was 10)
  with iter-advance, pause enforcement, phase-error circuit, prior_metrics
  history, and stall detection.

## [3.5.6] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed — embedded HTTP server auth-by-default (closes #61)

The embedded HTTP server now requires authentication on every endpoint
except `/health`. Previously it ran unauthenticated unless `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN`
was explicitly set (CWE-306).

| Mode                            | Trigger                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-generate** (new default) | unset env var → server writes a fresh 32-byte token to `~/.openclaw/server-token` (mode 0600) at startup. |
| **Explicit token** (unchanged)  | `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN=<value>`                                                                           |
| **Disabled** (opt-out, new)     | `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN=disabled` — single-user host only; logs a loud warning                             |

Three ways to authenticate (all equivalent):

1. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header — for CLIs / scripts.
2. `clawo_auth=<token>` cookie — set automatically when a browser hits
   `/dashboard?token=<token>`. Subsequent same-origin fetches and
   `EventSource` connections inherit the cookie.
3. `?token=<token>` query string — the bootstrap path for the dashboard;
   the server upgrades it to the cookie on the same response.

The `clawo` CLI now reads the token automatically (env vars
`CLAWO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN`, falling back to
`~/.openclaw/server-token`). The dashboard URL printed at server start
contains the token query — clicking it in a browser establishes the
cookie, after which the URL can be bookmarked at plain `/dashboard`.

### Changed

- 4 new tests in `src/__tests__/embedded-server.test.ts` cover the
  query-token → cookie handoff, cookie-only auth, the new auto-generate
  default, and the `disabled` sentinel.

## [3.5.5] - 2026-05-11

### Added — three-agent autoloop architecture

The previous autoloop (single-threaded phase machine that respawned a fresh
Claude session per phase) is replaced with three persistent agents:

- **Planner** (Opus, your chat interface) — long-lived; owns strategy,
  writes `plan.md` / `goal.json`, decides when to push you out-of-band.
- **Coder** (Sonnet) — receives directive, applies change, runs the
  evaluator, emits structured `iter_complete`.
- **Reviewer** (Sonnet, sandboxed cwd) — distrustful audit; advance /
  hold / rollback per iter.

Plugin tools: `autoloop_start`, `autoloop_chat`, `autoloop_status`,
`autoloop_list`, `autoloop_stop`, `autoloop_reset_agent`. The Planner
controls the run via fenced ` ```autoloop ` JSON blocks (`notify_user`,
`spawn_subagents`, `send_directive`, `pause_loop`, `resume_loop`,
`terminate`, `update_push_policy`, `write_plan_committed`,
`write_goal_committed`).

Push policy: silent on iter-done-ok; pushes on `target_hit`, 2-iter
regression, 2-iter reviewer reject, phase error, 30-min stall, or
decision-needed. 5-min dedup on (level, summary). Channels are configured
via env vars (`AUTOLOOP_WECHAT_RECIPIENT`, `AUTOLOOP_WECHAT_ACCOUNT`,
`AUTOLOOP_WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT`); an unset channel is silently skipped and
the fallback chain moves to the next tier (email via push-api-skill is
the final tier).

Auto-compact: per-agent thresholds (Planner 80%, Coder/Reviewer 70%) on
`getStats().contextPercent`; `/compact` dispatched with a role-specific
preservation hint; 30 s cooldown; surfaces as a `compact` SSE event.

### Added — embedded dashboard

Single-page vanilla dashboard at `GET /dashboard`. Two tabs:

- **Autoloop**: list of runs in left rail; click into one for a 3-pane
  view (Planner ⇄ user + chat composer / Coder activity / Reviewer
  verdicts). Top bar shows iter/status/push count; bottom strip shows
  recent pushes.
- **Council**: list of council sessions + live agent-response stream
  with round-by-round verdicts and consensus marker.

Backend HTTP/SSE: `GET /autoloop/list`, `/autoloop/<id>/state`,
`/autoloop/<id>/push_log`, `/autoloop/<id>/events`, and the same shape
for `/council/{list,<id>/state,<id>/events}`.

### Changed

- Build now `rm -rf dist` before `tsc` so renamed/relocated sources can't
  leave stale artefacts behind.

## [3.5.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added — auto-compact on context-budget threshold

Each agent session is monitored after every turn via `getStats().contextPercent`.
When it crosses the per-agent threshold the dispatcher dispatches `/compact`
with an agent-specific summary hint:

| Agent    | Default threshold | What `/compact` is told to preserve                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planner  | 80%               | current plan / goal, decisions with the user, what's been tried + rejected, user prefs, iter verdicts |
| Coder    | 70%               | codebase familiarity, attempted patches, current working state, plan + goal                           |
| Reviewer | 70%               | fakery patterns caught, recent metrics, structural rules from goal.json                               |

Per-run override via `compactThresholds: { planner?, coder?, reviewer? }` on
the dispatcher config. 30-second cooldown prevents back-to-back compactions.

Surfaces as a new `compact` SSE event on `/autoloop/<id>/events` (alongside
`planner_reply` / `coder_reply` / `reviewer_reply`); the embedded dashboard
renders it as an inline `[auto-compact 82% ≥ 80% — /compact dispatched]`
system entry in the relevant pane.

Closes the last design-doc deferred item (auto-compact, design doc §7.1).
Manual `autoloop_reset_agent` still available for nuclear reset.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- Autoloop HTTP routes (`/autoloop/<id>/state`, `/autoloop/<id>/push_log`,
  `/autoloop/<id>/events`) returned 404 in 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 because the
  regex patterns were `/^\/autoloop\/v2\/.../` (left-over from when the
  paths still had a `/v2/` prefix); the `/v2/` was stripped from URLs in
  the 3.5.0 collapse but the escaped slashes in the regex source weren't
  caught by the rename. Reported by `/dashboard` failing to populate the
  detail pane.

  `/autoloop/list` was unaffected (its match was a literal string compare,
  not a regex), so the dashboard sidebar populated correctly while the
  detail / push_log / SSE endpoints all 404'd.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added — embedded dashboard

Single-page vanilla dashboard at `GET /dashboard`, served by the embedded
HTTP server. Two tabs:

- **Autoloop** — list of active runs in the left rail; selecting one shows a
  3-pane view: Planner ⇄ user (with chat composer), Coder activity, Reviewer
  verdicts. Top bar surfaces `status / iter / subagents_spawned / push count`;
  bottom strip shows the last 20 push events. Live via SSE on `/autoloop/<id>/events`.
- **Council** — list of active council sessions; selecting one shows the
  agent-response stream (round-by-round, with a consensus marker on
  `agent-complete`). Live via SSE on `/council/<id>/events` (new in this release).

Zero new dependencies — single static `src/dashboard/index.html` (~870 lines,
inline CSS + vanilla JS using `EventSource`). Visual blueprint cribbed from
`webchat/app/council/council.module.scss` so colours and spacing match.

### Added — council SSE/HTTP endpoints

Mirrors the autoloop endpoints shipped in 3.5.0:

- `GET /council/list` — all council sessions known to the manager
- `GET /council/<id>/state` — current `CouncilSession` snapshot
- `GET /council/<id>/events` — SSE stream of `snapshot` + `council-event`
  events (every `Council` emit lands here)

`SessionManager` gains `councilList()` and `getCouncil(id)` helpers.

### Build

`scripts/postbuild.mjs` now copies non-TS dashboard assets from
`src/dashboard/` into `dist/src/dashboard/` so the published package serves
the page identically to dev.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-10

### ⚠️ Breaking — Autoloop replaced with three-agent architecture

The `autoloop_*` plugin tools shipped in 3.4.x kept their **names** but their
**signatures and semantics changed**. Specifically:

- `autoloop_start` now takes `{ run_id, workspace }` — no longer takes
  `plan_path` / `goal_path` (the Planner authors those itself in chat).
- `autoloop_resume` / `autoloop_inject` are **gone**. Replaced by
  `autoloop_chat` (talk to Planner directly) and `autoloop_reset_agent`
  (recover a drifted Coder/Reviewer).
- `tasks/<id>/state.json` schema is different. Old-shape ledgers from 3.4.x
  cannot be resumed by 3.5.x.
- Removed exports: the old phase-machine `AutoloopRunner`, plus `GoalSpec`
  / `GateSpec` / `ScalarSpec` / `AutoloopPhase` / `RatchetOutput` / etc
  (those were specific to the old phase machine; the new architecture's
  goal.json is free-form Planner-authored JSON).

If you have scripts calling 3.4.x autoloop tools, they will fail. Migration:
swap to `autoloop_start { run_id, workspace }` + `autoloop_chat` + give the
Planner a sentence describing the goal instead of writing plan.md/goal.json
yourself.

### Added — three-agent autoloop architecture

Replaced the single-threaded phase machine (BOOTSTRAP → PROPOSE → EXECUTE →
MEASURE → RATCHET → COMPRESS, fresh session per phase) with **three
persistent agents**:

- **Planner** (Opus) — your chat interface. Long-lived. Owns strategy,
  writes plan.md / goal.json, decides when to push you.
- **Coder** (Sonnet) — receives directive, makes the change, runs the
  evaluator, emits structured iter_complete.
- **Reviewer** (Sonnet, sandboxed cwd) — distrustful audit. Decides
  advance / hold / rollback per iter.

**Why:** the old machine paid context-rebuild cost every phase (token
waste) and had no specialisation accumulation. Persistent agents keep
codebase familiarity / fakery patterns warm across iterations.

**Plugin tools**: `autoloop_start`, `autoloop_chat`, `autoloop_status`,
`autoloop_list`, `autoloop_stop`, `autoloop_reset_agent`.

**Planner control** via fenced ` ```autoloop ` JSON blocks the dispatcher
parses out of every reply: `notify_user`, `spawn_subagents`,
`send_directive`, `pause_loop`, `resume_loop`, `terminate`,
`update_push_policy`, `write_plan_committed`, `write_goal_committed`.

**Push policy** (default): silent on iter-done-ok; push on target_hit,
2-iter regression, 2-iter reviewer reject, phase error, 30-min stall, or
explicit decision-needed. WeChat → WhatsApp → email fallback chain
(mirrors push-api-skill SKILL.md §B). 5-minute dedup on (level, summary).

**Backend SSE/HTTP** for the upcoming 3-pane UI:

- `GET /autoloop/list`
- `GET /autoloop/<id>/state`
- `GET /autoloop/<id>/push_log`
- `GET /autoloop/<id>/events` — SSE: `snapshot` / `message` / `state` /
  `push` / `iter_done` / `planner_reply` / `coder_reply` / `reviewer_reply`
  / `terminated`

**Ledger** under `<workspace>/tasks/<run_id>/`: `plan.md`, `goal.json`,
`push_log.jsonl`, `iter/<n>/{directive,eval_output,diff.patch,verdict}.json`,
`reviewer_sandbox/` (Reviewer cwd; runner restages per-iter artifacts).

**Validated**: live e2e smoke converged the buggy add_two scenario in one
iter with Opus Planner + Sonnet × 2.

### Deferred (v3.5.x follow-ups)

- **Auto-compact on token-budget threshold** — manual `autoloop_reset_agent`
  covers the same recovery paths today.
- **WeChat-inbound replies → Planner** — currently one-way push; reply via
  webchat / `autoloop_chat`.
- **ChatGPT-Next-Web 3-pane UI** — separate cross-repo PR (backend
  contract is shipped in this release).

## [3.4.2] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Minor wording cleanup in autoloop reference docs and CHANGELOG. No functional changes; the 3.4.1 release is identical in behaviour. Use 3.4.2 going forward.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed — autoloop production-readiness pass

After end-to-end smoke and Scenario 2 (paper review) live runs, five fixes:

- **Cost tracking via `manager.getCost()`** — replaced events-based extraction (which silently returned `$0` because the event stream is empty without `bare:true`) with `readCostUsd(manager, sessionName, result)` that queries the session's authoritative cost before stop. Verified: smoke now reports `$0.40` (was `$0.00`).
- **`autoloop_resume` tool + SessionManager.autoloopResume()** — recover from orchestrator process death (gateway restart, OOM, machine reboot). Reads `tasks/<id>/state.json` + `plan.md` + `goal.json`, skips BOOTSTRAP, git-resets workspace to last best (or `bootstrap_sha` baseline), continues from next iter. Refuses to resume already-terminated runs.
- **`ScalarSpec.extract_timeout_sec`** — separates the scalar's shell wall-clock from the LLM-call cap. Default 600s; for long ML evals set e.g. `14400` (4h) in `goal.json`. Previously shared `per_iter_timeout_ms`.
- **Scope discipline in propose + ratchet prompts** — `plan.md`'s `## Scope` / `## Constraints` / `## Read-only files` / `## Allowed paths` blocks are now HARD constraints. RATCHET rule #2 is "Scope violation → reset" (between gate-regression and aspirational-only). PROPOSE prompt explicitly enumerates how to interpret each constraint type. Default to narrower interpretation when ambiguous.
- **`state.json.bootstrap_sha`** — captured after BOOTSTRAP succeeds. Used by `gitReset` and `autoloop_resume` as a stable rollback floor when no `best` exists yet (avoids the previous `HEAD~1` ping-pong on failed proposes during early iters).

### Fixed — earlier post-merge fixes already shipped under 3.4.0 are listed here for completeness

- **`bare: true` removed from autoloop child sessions** — claude `--bare` skips `~/.claude/settings.json` env loading, breaking auth via the custom env loaded from settings.json. Real fix is upstream in `persistent-session.ts`; autoloop's workaround is to drop `bare`.
- **Robust RATCHET JSON parser** — Sonnet often wraps JSON in prose / code fences. Old parser missed → silently `{decision: "reset", reason: "malformed"}`, which rolled back every successful PROPOSE. New parser tries trim, fence-strip, and brace-balanced extraction; saves raw output to `iter/<n>/ratchet-raw.txt` for forensics.
- **Public exports** — `AutoloopRunner`, `AutoloopConfig`, type re-exports added to `src/index.ts`.

### Added — Scenario 2 starter and tests

- `scripts/scenario2-paper-review.ts` — end-to-end paper-review demo. `ARXIV_ID=<id> npx tsx scripts/scenario2-paper-review.ts` — downloads arxiv PDF, sets up workspace with structural gates (≥1500 words, 6 required sections, ≥5 citations, ≥8 slides), runs autoloop. Verified on arxiv 2210.02747 (Lipman et al, Flow Matching): 11/11 gates, 1 iter, 5 min wall-clock, $0.87 with sonnet/sonnet.
- `scripts/test-resume.ts` — start, stop after BOOTSTRAP, fresh SessionManager + `autoloopResume`, verify pytest passes.
- `scripts/test-multi-iter.ts` — workspace with 4 independent bugs in 4 files, verifies multi-iter ratcheting, monotonic `metric.json`, ≥2 propose commits on the autoloop branch.

### Known limitations

- Multi-day runs are still vulnerable to mid-phase process death — `autoloop_resume` only handles "between phases" deaths cleanly. Mid-COMPRESS or mid-RATCHET pipe death may leave inconsistent ledger.
- Scenario 1 (real ML training loop on remote box) needs `ssh <remote-host> …` wrapped inside `extract_cmd`. Native remote runner is a v2 item.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added — `autoloop` (autonomous workspace iteration)

New first-class feature alongside session / council / ultraplan / ultrareview. Given a git workspace, a `plan.md` (intent), and a `goal.json` (success criteria with scalar and/or gates), the loop runs autonomously until the goal is met, max iters/cost is hit, or the user stops it.

- **Phase machine**: `BOOTSTRAP → { PROPOSE → EXECUTE → MEASURE → RATCHET → maybe COMPRESS }* → TERMINATED`
- **Asymmetric ratchet reviewer**: separate process, sandboxed cwd (cannot read workspace source), stdin-only artifact passing, JSON-only decision output. Default verdict is reset; commit requires positive evidence (see `configs/autoloop-ratchet-prompt.md`)
- **Two scenarios covered by one schema**: scalar-driven (Karpathy autoresearch shape) and gate-driven (paper deep-research shape with aspirational gates)
- **Push hooks**: async via `openclaw message send` (configurable). Triggers on new-best, plateau, aspirational gate proposed, termination, hard error. Inner loop never blocks on stdin
- **Kill switches**: per-iter wall-clock (process-group SIGKILL via `spawn detached: true`), `max_iters`, `max_cost_usd`. Token cap alone does not catch hung subprocesses
- **Atomic ledger**: `tasks/<id>/{plan.md, goal.json, current.md, state.json, metric.json, history.md, iter/<n>/...}` co-located with the workspace so `git reset` reverts ledger and code atomically
- **State schema supports population from day 1**: `state.json.tree.children_iters` is a list, even though v1 runs serial — future N-worktree mode reuses the same ledger
- **Tools**: `autoloop_start`, `autoloop_status`, `autoloop_list`, `autoloop_inject`, `autoloop_stop`
- **SSE endpoint**: `GET /autoloop/<id>/events` streams phase / state / push events. Frontend (webchat) deferred to a future release

Reference: `skills/references/autoloop.md`.

**Defaults** (cost not optimised per user direction): `propose=opus, ratchet=opus`, `max_iters=200`, `max_cost_usd=200`, `compress_every_k=10`, `per_iter_timeout_ms=600000`. Override via `goal.json.termination` or `autoloop_start` parameters.

Resume after process death is **not** supported in v1 — if the orchestrator process dies, `state.json` and `current.md` are intact but the loop must be restarted. Running concurrent autoloops on the same workspace is not supported (they would race on the same git branch).

## [3.3.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **#60 — `/plan` isn't available in this environment.** The `plan: true` option in `sendMessage` previously prepended `/plan` to the message, which is a Claude Code interactive-only slash command not available in `--stream-json` mode or any other engine. Replaced with a universally compatible instruction-based planning prefix (`[Planning Mode] ...`) in both `persistent-session.ts` and `persistent-custom-session.ts`. Tested across Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added — `engine: 'opencode'` for [sst/opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)

New first-class engine wrapper alongside Claude / Codex / Gemini / Cursor. Wraps `opencode run --format json --dangerously-skip-permissions` as a one-shot per `send()`.

- Parses opencode's NDJSON envelope (`{ type, timestamp, sessionID, ...data }`) with `text`, `reasoning`, `tool_use`, `step_start`, `step_finish`, `error` event types
- `text` and `tool_use` are cumulative snapshots keyed by `part.id` / `part.callID`; the parser diffs them so `onText` callbacks receive streaming deltas and tool-call counts only increment on first sight
- Real token usage from `step_finish.part.tokens.{input, output, cache.read}` (falls back to estimation if no `step_finish` arrives)
- `--model` is passed through only when the configured model contains a `/` (opencode's `provider/model` convention); otherwise opencode's default applies
- Wrapper closes child stdin immediately after spawn (opencode otherwise blocks waiting for EOF and the subprocess hangs)
- Auth: opencode reads either its own credential store (`opencode auth login`) **or** the standard provider env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, …); the wrapper passes through the parent process env unchanged
- New env var `OPENCODE_BIN` to override the binary path (defaults to `opencode`)
- 17 unit tests covering the parser; verified end-to-end against opencode CLI **1.1.40** with both a plain text send (`say hi`) and a tool-calling send (`create hello.txt`)

Schema is undocumented upstream and the project releases nearly daily — pin a version in CI if you depend on field names.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **#57 — `dist/index.js` missing.** OpenClaw's plugin loader resolves entry points by convention (`./dist/index.js`) rather than reading `package.json#main`, so v3.1.0 installs emitted a load-time warning. Added a `postbuild` step that writes `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts` shims re-exporting from `dist/src/index.js`. `package.json#main` is unchanged.

### Changed — Tool name collisions with OpenClaw built-ins (#58)

OpenClaw 2026.5.x ships its own `session_status` and `agents_list` tools at the gateway level. The plugin's identically-named tools triggered `plugin tool name conflict` warnings on every gateway restart, and dispatch was ambiguous when an LLM called either name. Renamed the two colliding tools:

| Before           | After                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `session_status` | `coding_session_status` |
| `agents_list`    | `coding_agents_list`    |

No aliases — the conflicting names couldn't be invoked reliably anyway. All other tool names (and the rest of the API surface) are unchanged. If you have callers that hard-coded these two names, update them.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-04

### Breaking — Hard Brand Cleanup

- Removed the `claude-code-skill` CLI alias; `clawo` is now the only package binary.
- Removed the deprecated `claude_*` tool aliases from plugin registration and `openclaw.plugin.json` contracts.
- Removed the `skills/claude-code-skill/` back-compat symlink.

### Removed

- Removed old-name references from current docs, help text, examples, skill text, comments, package metadata, and proxy identifiers outside explicit migration/history material.

### Changed

- Bumped the package version to `3.1.0`.
- Updated tests to assert that only engine-neutral tool names are registered.
- Added canonical plugin proxy route `/v1/claw-orchestrator-proxy`; the old `/v1/claude-code-proxy` route remains registered as a compatibility alias for callers that did not receive a v3.0 deprecation window.
- Added canonical CLI base URL override env var `CLAWO_API_URL`; `CLAUDE_CODE_API_URL` remains accepted as a fallback for callers that did not receive a v3.0 deprecation window.
- Kept the install-time cleanup for stale `openclaw-claude-code` plugin config so direct v2.x -> v3.1 upgrades still remove legacy OpenClaw entries; also restored the symmetric `npm ls -g` warning when the deprecated global package is still installed, so users on a v2.x -> v3.1 jump are reminded to `npm uninstall -g @enderfga/openclaw-claude-code` at their convenience.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-04

### Brand Rebrand

Project repositioned as **Claw Orchestrator** — a multi-engine coding-agent runtime for claw-style agent systems. Runs standalone, with first-class OpenClaw plugin support and a path to other claw-style agent platforms.

- npm package renamed: `@enderfga/openclaw-claude-code` → `@enderfga/claw-orchestrator`. The old package has been deprecated on npm with a moved-to message; existing installs keep working.
- GitHub repository renamed: `Enderfga/openclaw-claude-code` → `Enderfga/claw-orchestrator`. GitHub auto-redirects existing URLs and clones; `install.sh` raw URL is now `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enderfga/claw-orchestrator/main/install.sh`.
- OpenClaw plugin id renamed: `openclaw-claude-code` → `claw-orchestrator`. The new `install.sh` strips legacy v2.x entries from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` automatically on upgrade and warns if the legacy global package is still installed.
- CLI binary renamed: `claude-code-skill` → `clawo`. The old binary remains installed as an alias for the v3.0.x line and will be removed in v3.1.
- Skill name renamed: `claude-code-skill` → `claw-orchestrator`. The `skills/claude-code-skill/` directory is preserved as a back-compat symlink for the v3.0.x line.
- Banner updated.
- Log prefixes updated from `[openclaw-claude-code]` to `[claw-orchestrator]`.

### Breaking — Tool API rename (with deprecation aliases)

The 17 `claude_*`-prefixed tools were renamed to engine-neutral names. The old names remain registered as deprecated aliases for the v3.0.x line and will be removed in v3.1. The `codex_*`, `council_*`, `ultraplan_*`, `ultrareview_*` tool names are unchanged.

| Old name (alias, deprecated)   | New name (canonical)    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `claude_session_start`         | `session_start`         |
| `claude_session_send`          | `session_send`          |
| `claude_session_stop`          | `session_stop`          |
| `claude_session_list`          | `session_list`          |
| `claude_sessions_overview`     | `sessions_overview`     |
| `claude_session_status`        | `session_status`        |
| `claude_session_grep`          | `session_grep`          |
| `claude_session_compact`       | `session_compact`       |
| `claude_agents_list`           | `agents_list`           |
| `claude_team_list`             | `team_list`             |
| `claude_team_send`             | `team_send`             |
| `claude_session_update_tools`  | `session_update_tools`  |
| `claude_session_switch_model`  | `session_switch_model`  |
| `claude_project_purge`         | `project_purge`         |
| `claude_session_send_to`       | `session_send_to`       |
| `claude_session_inbox`         | `session_inbox`         |
| `claude_session_deliver_inbox` | `session_deliver_inbox` |

Calling a deprecated name still works; the tool description in OpenClaw's tool listing is prefixed with `[DEPRECATED — use <new-name>; this alias is removed in v3.1]` to nudge migration.

The plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`) `contracts.tools` now lists 35 canonical tools plus 17 deprecated aliases (52 entries total) so both old and new names remain discoverable.

### Fixed

- **CLI version reporting** — `clawo --version` (and the legacy `claude-code-skill --version`) now correctly reads the package version. Previously resolved `../package.json` relative to `dist/bin/cli.js`, which silently fell back to `0.0.0`.

### Migration Guide

```bash
# 1. Uninstall the old package
npm uninstall -g @enderfga/openclaw-claude-code

# 2. Install the new package
npm install -g @enderfga/claw-orchestrator

# 3. (If you use OpenClaw) re-run install.sh to migrate the plugin entry
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enderfga/claw-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash
```

Update any scripts that invoke the CLI by name from `claude-code-skill` to `clawo`. Tool callers in agents/MCP clients can continue using `claude_*` names through v3.0.x but should plan to migrate to the engine-neutral names before upgrading to v3.1.

### Unchanged

- `OPENCLAW_*` environment variables (`OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL`, `OPENCLAW_SERVE_MAX_SESSIONS`, `OPENCLAW_SERVE_TTL_MINUTES`, `OPENCLAW_RATE_LIMIT`, `OPENCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS`, `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN`)
- TypeScript public exports (`SessionManager`, `Council`, `PersistentClaudeSession`, etc.)
- `peerDependencies.openclaw` requirement
- Engine compatibility (Claude Code 2.1.126, Codex 0.128.0, Gemini 0.36.0, Cursor Agent 2026.03.30)

---

## [2.15.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added — Codex CLI 0.128.0 alignment + `/goal` support

Bumped tested Codex CLI from `0.118.0` to `0.128.0`. The wrapper had drifted ten minor versions; this release brings it current and adds long-horizon objective support via Codex's app-server protocol.

#### Codex `exec` path (`engine: 'codex'`)

- **Spawn args modernized**. Replaced the deprecated `--full-auto` flag with `--sandbox workspace-write` (avoids the per-spawn deprecation warning Codex 0.124+ emits). Added `--json` so output is line-delimited JSON events instead of free-form text.
- **JSONL event parser**. New parser consumes Codex's `thread.started`, `turn.started`, `item.completed` (`agent_message` and tool-use variants), and `turn.completed` events. Replaces the old char-count token estimate with the real `usage` payload (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens` — the latter two are new in Codex 0.125).
- **Per-session thread continuity**. The `thread_id` from each session's first `thread.started` event is captured and reused via `codex exec resume <id>` for subsequent sends, so the model sees prior turns instead of starting fresh each send.
- **`supportsCachedTokens: true`**. The Codex engine now reports cached input tokens and applies cached pricing in cost calculations (the path was already implemented in `BaseOneShotSession`; this just flips the flag).
- **Default model bumped** from `o4-mini` → `gpt-5.5`. New `gpt-5.5` entry added to `models.ts` (pricing currently mirrors `gpt-5.4` as a `TODO` placeholder until OpenAI publishes official numbers).
- **New `sandboxMode` field** on `SessionConfig` — `'read-only' | 'workspace-write' | 'danger-full-access'`. Defaults to `workspace-write` (matches old `--full-auto` behavior).

#### New one-shot tools

- **`codex_resume`** — wraps `codex exec resume [SESSION_ID|--last] [PROMPT]` (Codex 0.119+) for cross-process thread continuity. Returns `{ text, threadId, usage, events }`.
- **`codex_review`** — wraps `codex review [PROMPT] [--uncommitted | --base BRANCH | --commit SHA]`. Plain-text output (Codex's review subcommand does not emit JSON).

#### `/goal` long-horizon objectives — new `codex-app` engine

- **`PersistentCodexAppServerSession`** — new session class wrapping `codex app-server --listen stdio:// --enable goals`. Speaks Codex's v2 JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over stdio. Required for `/goal` because `codex exec` has no slash-command surface.
- **`engine: 'codex-app'`** — new engine type. Long-running subprocess (one `app-server` per session); real-time streaming via `item/agentMessage/delta` notifications; cumulative token tracking via `thread/tokenUsage/updated`.
- **Goal lifecycle observation** — subscribes to `thread/goal/updated` and `thread/goal/cleared` notifications. Cached state available via `getStats().goal` and the `codex_goal_get` tool.
- **5 new tools**: `codex_goal_set`, `codex_goal_get`, `codex_goal_pause`, `codex_goal_resume`, `codex_goal_clear`. The mutation tools are convenience wrappers — internally they send `/goal <args>` as user text via `turn/start`, since Codex's v2 protocol has no client-side goal-mutation RPCs (verified via `codex app-server generate-json-schema`). Each tool errors clearly when called against a non-`codex-app` session.

> **Feature-flag risk.** The `goals` feature is marked "under development" in Codex 0.128.0 and has a known bug (issue #20591). The session class always passes `--enable goals` so it works the moment upstream stabilizes; during the transition some goal commands may fail server-side. The wrapper layer is unaffected by upstream churn.

#### Skipped

`codex cloud`, `codex apply`, MCP-server management subcommands, `codex exec-server`, `codex sandbox`, the `@openai/codex-sdk` npm package — all noted in research but deferred. None affect existing wrapper behavior.

## [2.14.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added — Claude Code CLI 2.1.122 → 2.1.126 sync

Bumped the tested Claude CLI from `2.1.121` to `2.1.126`. Net-new surface from this window:

- **`bedrockServiceTier`** (CLI 2.1.122) — new `SessionConfig` field. Sets `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER`, which the CLI forwards as the `X-Amzn-Bedrock-Service-Tier` header. Values: `default | flex | priority`. Only effective when routing through AWS Bedrock.
- **`claude_project_purge` tool** (CLI 2.1.126) — wraps `claude project purge` to delete Claude Code project state (transcripts, tasks, file history, config entry). **Defaults to dry-run** for safety; pass `dry_run: false` to actually delete. Supports per-path purge or `all: true`.

Skipped (passive / interactive-only): OTel numeric attribute fix and `invocation_trigger` (passive — no wrapper change), `/v1/models` gateway discovery (handled at the gateway, not here), `--dangerously-skip-permissions` scope expansion, PowerShell primary-shell improvements, `/resume` PR-URL search.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **`team_list` / `team_send` on Claude engine** — earlier code assumed Claude Code CLI exposed `/team` and `@teammate` as user-facing commands. They do not. `team_list` returned `Unknown command: /team` and `team_send` sent the message as plain prose with a stray `@name` prefix. Both tools now use the same engine-agnostic virtual-team layer (cross-session inbox routing) for every engine. Claude Code's native experimental Agent Teams (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, v2.1.32+) is an in-process TUI mechanism with no stdin-driven messaging surface, so a subprocess wrapper cannot drive it. Thanks @shendiid ([#48](https://github.com/Enderfga/openclaw-claude-code/issues/48))
- Removed unused `TEAM_LIST_TIMEOUT_MS` and `TEAM_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS` constants
- Updated README, SKILL.md, and `multi-engine.md` to describe the unified virtual-team behavior

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Claude Code CLI 2.1.121 sync

Bumped the tested Claude CLI from `2.1.111` to `2.1.121`. New `SessionConfig` fields:

- **`forkSubagent`** — sets `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1` to fork subagent for non-interactive sessions
- **`enableToolSearch`** — sets `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=1` to enable Vertex AI tool search
- **`otelLogUserPrompts`** — sets `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1` for OpenTelemetry user prompt logging
- **`otelLogRawApiBodies`** — sets `OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES=1` for OpenTelemetry raw API body logging (debug only)
- **`xhigh` effort level** — new Opus 4.7 effort tier between `high` and `max`. Triggers `ultrathink` prefix on user messages, same as `high` and `max`
- **`stats.pluginErrors`** — captured from `system/init` event when CLI plugins fail to load due to unmet dependencies (`{plugin, reason}[]`)

Distributed tracing (`TRACEPARENT` / `TRACESTATE`) is automatically forwarded since the parent process env is inherited by the child — no new code needed, just set them in the parent before starting the session.

### Notes — behavior changes from upstream Claude CLI 2.1.121

- `--agent` / `--print` now enforce agent frontmatter `permissionMode`, `tools`, and `disallowedTools` (previously advisory). Affects `council` agent personas.
- `Bash(find:*)` permission rule no longer auto-approves `find -exec` or `find -delete`. If you were relying on the previous behavior, add explicit rules.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` now also skips prompts for `.claude/skills/`. Treat with care.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Windows path resolution in council** — replaced manual `import.meta.url.replace('file://', '')` with `fileURLToPath()` in `src/council.ts`. The hand-rolled stripping left a leading `/` on Windows file URLs (`file:///C:/...` → `/C:/...`), breaking config path resolution and the project-directory safety check. Thanks @shendiid ([#47](https://github.com/Enderfga/openclaw-claude-code/pull/47))
- **Council safety check now uses `path.relative` instead of POSIX-only `'/'` separator** — the `moduleRoot + '/'` prefix check was Windows-incorrect (`\` vs `/`); now uses `path.relative()` so the safety guard works across platforms

## [2.13.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Claude Code CLI 2.1.111 support** — updated tested version from 2.1.91 to 2.1.111
- **Hook event streaming** — `includeHookEvents` option passes `--include-hook-events` for PreToolUse/PostToolUse lifecycle events
- **Permission delegation** — `permissionPromptTool` option passes `--permission-prompt-tool` for non-interactive MCP-based permission handling
- **Prompt cache optimization** — `excludeDynamicSystemPromptSections` option passes `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` to improve prompt cache hit rate. Auto-enabled when `bare: true`
- **1-hour prompt cache** — `enablePromptCaching1H` option sets `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` env var for 1-hour cache TTL. Auto-enabled when `bare: true`
- **Debug control** — `debug` and `debugFile` options pass `--debug` and `--debug-file` for targeted debug output by category
- **GitHub PR sessions** — `fromPr` option passes `--from-pr` to resume sessions linked to a pull request
- **MCP Channels** — `channels` and `dangerouslyLoadDevelopmentChannels` options for MCP channel subscriptions (research preview)
- **API retry tracking** — `system/api_retry` events are now parsed, with `retries` and `lastRetryError` exposed in session stats
- **Smart defaults** — `bare: true` now auto-enables `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` and `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` unless explicitly disabled

## [2.12.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **OpenAI-compat: eliminated periodic 30–50s latency spikes** — tool definitions (`<available_tools>`) are now embedded in the session system prompt at create time instead of being prepended to every user message. For callers with many tools (e.g. 90+ MCP tools, ~50 KB payload), this enables reliable Anthropic prompt cache hits and eliminates a class of latency spikes that occurred every ~4 calls. Warm call latency drops from 3–45s (with spikes) to a stable 3–4s ([#43](https://github.com/Enderfga/openclaw-claude-code/pull/43))
- **OpenAI-compat: session key now includes tool fingerprint** — prevents two callers with the same system prompt but different tool lists from sharing a stale session
- **OpenAI-compat: extracted `buildSessionSystemPrompt()` helper** — deduplicated near-identical prompt strings, improved testability

### Added

- **Opt-out env var `OPENAI_COMPAT_TOOLS_PER_MESSAGE=1`** — restores pre-fix per-turn tool injection for callers that mutate their tool list within a single session
- 13 new unit tests covering tool fingerprinting, system prompt construction, and env var parsing (421 total)

## [2.12.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Proxy: configurable Anthropic base URL** — three-layer fallback (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var → `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` providers → official API), enabling MiniMax and other Anthropic-compatible endpoints without patching code
- **Proxy: removed hardcoded `minimax-portal` provider preference** — now uses first provider with a `baseUrl` from config, making the fallback generic
- **Proxy: base URL resolution cached** — avoids synchronous filesystem reads on every request
- **Proxy: config parse errors now logged** — `console.warn` instead of silent swallow
- **Skill directory** — added `skills/claude-code-skill/` subdirectory symlink for OpenClaw skill loader compatibility

### Changed

- `skills/claude-code-skill/SKILL.md` is a symlink to `skills/SKILL.md` (single source of truth)

## [2.12.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Structured logging** — new `Logger` interface with `createConsoleLogger(prefix)` and `nullLogger`. Log level controlled via `OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL` env var (debug/info/warn/error). SessionManager and Council now accept optional `logger` parameter instead of using bare `console.*`
- **`BaseOneShotSession` base class** — shared abstract class for one-shot (process-per-send) engines. Eliminates ~600 lines of duplication across Codex, Gemini, and Cursor session implementations
- **`CircuitBreaker` class** — extracted from SessionManager into standalone module (`src/circuit-breaker.ts`) with `check()`, `recordFailure()`, `reset()`, `getStatus()` API
- **`InboxManager` class** — extracted cross-session messaging from SessionManager into standalone module (`src/inbox-manager.ts`) with `sendTo()`, `inbox()`, `deliverInbox()`, `clear()` API
- New exports: `BaseOneShotSession`, `OneShotEngineConfig`, `Logger`, `createConsoleLogger`, `nullLogger`, `CircuitBreaker`, `InboxManager`, `SessionLookup`

### Fixed

- **openai-compat: unsafe type assertion in `parseToolCallsFromText`** — tool call array elements are now validated at runtime before use, preventing crashes on malformed model output
- **gemini-session / cursor-session: redundant dead branches** — merged identical error-handling branches in process close handlers
- **Sensitive content removed** — cleaned internal service references and personal paths from code comments and documentation examples

### Changed

- `PersistentCodexSession` now extends `BaseOneShotSession` (317 → 120 lines)
- `PersistentGeminiSession` now extends `BaseOneShotSession` (419 → 238 lines)
- `PersistentCursorSession` now extends `BaseOneShotSession` (441 → 264 lines)
- `SessionManager` reduced from ~1704 to ~1596 lines via CircuitBreaker and InboxManager extraction
- All `console.log/warn/error` calls in SessionManager and Council replaced with injected `Logger`
- `skills/SKILL.md` examples updated from CLI format to tool-call format

## [2.11.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **openai-compat: `--system-prompt` replaces CLI default tools during function calling** — when tools are provided via the OpenAI API, the bridge now uses `--system-prompt` (replace mode) instead of `--append-system-prompt` to suppress Claude Code's built-in tools, preventing the agent from executing host tools instead of returning `tool_calls`
- **openai-compat: `tool_calls` arguments not always valid JSON** — `parseToolCallsFromText` now ensures the `arguments` field is always a JSON string, wrapping raw values in a JSON object when needed
- **openai-compat: only first `<tool_calls>` block parsed** — all `<tool_calls>` blocks in a response are now parsed, with output limited to one block per response to match the OpenAI protocol
- **openai-compat: single-block restriction in tool prompt removed** — `buildToolPromptBlock` no longer restricts the prompt to a single tool definition block, allowing multi-tool prompts
- **openai-compat: `<tool_result>` tags leaked into response content** — response text is now stripped of `<tool_result>` tags before being returned to the client
- **openai-compat: tool results processed even when last message is not tool role** — tool result serialization now only triggers when the last non-system message has `role: 'tool'`, preventing stale tool results from being re-injected on user follow-ups
- **openai-compat: ephemeral sessions not cleaned up** — sessions created for one-shot `/v1/chat/completions` requests without an `X-Session-Id` are now stopped immediately after the response completes

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **OpenAI function calling support for openai-compat endpoint** — the `/v1/chat/completions` bridge now supports the full OpenAI tool use protocol:
  - Accepts `tools` array from requests (previously silently dropped)
  - Injects tool definitions into the prompt via `<available_tools>` block
  - Parses `<tool_calls>` tags from model responses into proper `message.tool_calls` format
  - Returns `finish_reason: 'tool_calls'` when tool calls are detected
  - Supports `tool` role messages for multi-turn tool result injection
  - Streaming mode buffers response when tools present, emits `delta.tool_calls` chunks
  - For Claude engine: disables CLI built-in tools (`--tools ""`) to prevent the agent from executing tools on the host instead of returning `tool_calls`
- New exported functions: `buildToolPromptBlock()`, `parseToolCallsFromText()`, `serializeToolResults()`
- 19 new unit tests for function calling (tool prompt building, response parsing, tool result serialization, multi-turn flow)

### Fixed

- **openai-compat session cwd** — uses empty temp directory instead of `process.cwd()` to prevent the CLI from loading CLAUDE.md and workspace context from the serve directory
- **`tools: ''` falsy check** — empty string is now correctly passed through as `--tools ""` (previously skipped due to truthiness check)

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Custom Engine (`engine: 'custom'`)** — integrate any coding agent CLI without writing engine-specific code. Users provide a `CustomEngineConfig` that maps CLI flags to OpenClaw session concepts. Supports two modes:
  - **Persistent** (`persistent: true`) — long-running subprocess with stream-json I/O over stdin/stdout (for Claude Code-compatible CLIs)
  - **One-shot** (`persistent: false`, default) — new process per `send()` (for simpler CLIs)
- Full config surface: binary path, flag mappings, permission mode translation, pricing, context window, env vars, stderr sanitization patterns
- Custom engines work in **council** — set `engine: 'custom'` + `customEngine` on agent personas
- New source file: `src/persistent-custom-session.ts` implementing `ISession`
- New type: `CustomEngineConfig` in `src/types.ts`
- New export: `PersistentCustomSession` from package entry point

## [2.9.4] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **openai-compat: system prompt not injected for non-Claude engines** — Cursor, Codex, and Gemini CLIs don't support `--append-system-prompt`, so the upstream caller's system prompt (OpenClaw agent identity, tool definitions, workspace context) was silently dropped. Now prepended as `<system>...</system>` to the user message on every turn for non-Claude engines.
- **openai-compat: removed forceNonStream** — returning JSON when the gateway sent `stream: true` caused a protocol mismatch; the OpenAI SDK expected SSE, so webchat received no reply. Streaming with the fixed heartbeat comment format handles cold-start delay correctly.

### Added

- **Cursor Auto model routing** — `model: "auto"` now resolves to the `cursor` engine, enabling Cursor's unlimited Auto mode as a primary backend via the OpenAI-compat bridge.
- **openai-compat: optional status webhook (`OPENAI_COMPAT_STATUS_URL`)** — best-effort `POST` JSON `{ state, activity, tool }` at request start, on each CLI `tool_use` event (human-readable `activity`), when the turn completes (`state: idle`), and on handler failure (so UIs don't stick on `thinking`). Enables a webchat status bar or other dashboard to show live agent activity without parsing SSE.

## [2.9.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **openai-compat: persistent CLI destroyed every turn (#40)** — `extractUserMessage()`'s `nonSystemMessages.length <= 1` heuristic fired on every request for clients that forward only the latest user turn (OpenClaw main agent, cron jobs, subagents), causing `stopSession` + `startSession` on every turn, destroying the persistent CLI, and preventing Anthropic prompt caching from ever warming. The heuristic is now off by default; clients that want the old behavior set `OPENAI_COMPAT_NEW_CONVO_HEURISTIC=1`. All clients can still force a reset via `X-Session-Reset: 1` (now also accepted case-insensitively with whitespace).
- **openai-compat: unkeyed callers collapsed onto one shared session (#40)** — `resolveSessionKey()` returned the literal string `'default'` when neither `X-Session-Id` nor `user` was set, so multi-caller setups all shared one `openai-default` plugin session and could see each other's `appendSystemPrompt` (a privacy leak across distinct callers). Now falls back to `'sys-<sha1(model + systemPrompt)>'` so distinct callers land on distinct sessions.
- **openai-compat: session key ignored requested model (#40)** — two callers with the same system prompt but different requested models collided onto one session and silently got responses from whichever model the session was created with. Model is now mixed into the hash input.
- **session-manager: concurrent `sendMessage()` race on the same session** — `PersistentClaudeSession`'s single-slot `_streamCallbacks` and shared `TURN_COMPLETE` listener could race when two callers sent on the same session simultaneously, causing the second caller to receive the first caller's response. `SessionManager.sendMessage()` now serializes per-session via a chained promise, with failure isolation so a thrown send doesn't poison the chain.
- **openai-compat: SSE heartbeat killed streaming for OpenAI SDK clients** — `writeSSE(':keepalive')` produced `data: :keepalive\n\n` which the OpenAI SDK's `SSEDecoder` tried to `JSON.parse`, throwing `SyntaxError` and aborting the stream. Replaced with a proper SSE comment (`': keepalive\n\n'`), interval increased from 15s to 30s. This was the root cause of `outputs: []` when the OpenClaw gateway's agent loop (43KB system prompt, >15s first-token latency) streamed through the bridge.
- **openai-compat: new sessions forced non-streaming on first turn** — Claude CLI needs 3-15s to boot and process the system prompt. Upstream clients (OpenClaw gateway, OpenAI SDK) would close the streaming connection before the first content chunk arrived. The bridge now forces non-streaming mode for the first turn of a new session, then allows streaming on subsequent turns where the CLI is already warm (<1s first-token).
- **openai-compat: poisoned session auto-resume from disk** — sessions that crashed during creation (e.g. `claude` not in PATH) were persisted to `claude-sessions.json`. On every server restart, `SessionManager._doStartSession` auto-resumed the broken `claudeSessionId`, producing zero-output sessions that could never recover. OpenAI-compat sessions now set `skipPersistence: true` + `noSessionPersistence: true` so they never persist to disk and never auto-resume stale CLI state.
- **openai-compat: `content` field as array not handled** — the OpenAI API allows `content` as `string | Array<{type, text}>` (multimodal messages). `extractUserMessage` now normalizes array content via a `textOf()` helper instead of assuming string.
- **openai-compat: `OpenAIChatMessage` type too narrow** — added `role: 'tool'`, `content: null | Array`, `tool_calls`, `tool_call_id` fields. `OpenAIChatCompletionRequest` now includes `tools`, `max_completion_tokens`. These fields are accepted but intentionally not forwarded to the Claude CLI — the bridge delegates all tool use to Claude Code's own tool system.

### Added

- **`OPENAI_COMPAT_NEW_CONVO_HEURISTIC` env var** — opt-in legacy heuristic for webchat frontends that re-send the full transcript (ChatGPT-Next-Web, Open WebUI, etc).
- **`GET /v1/sessions` inspection endpoint** — lists active OpenAI-compat sessions with `cached_tokens`, `tokens_in/out`, `turns`, `context_percent`, `cost_usd`. Production observability for verifying that prompt caching is actually warming. Bearer-token gated like the rest of `/v1/*`.
- **Serve-mode tuning env vars** — `OPENCLAW_SERVE_MAX_SESSIONS` (default 32, was 5) and `OPENCLAW_SERVE_TTL_MINUTES` (default 60, was 120). Plugin-mode defaults are unchanged.
- **`skills/references/openai-compat.md`** — dedicated reference for the OpenAI-compat bridge: session keying rules, the two operator modes, env vars, smoke-test recipes.
- **Tests** — 11 new unit tests covering: positive `X-Session-Reset` (1/true/case-insensitive/whitespace), negative reset values, distinct hash by system prompt, distinct hash by model, model-only hash, legacy-heuristic env-var restore, per-session send mutex serialization, mutex recovery from a failed send.

### Important

- **Extra usage billing**: When OpenClaw's agent loop routes through this bridge, Anthropic recognizes the system prompt signature as programmatic/agent traffic and bills it against Claude Code's **extra usage** quota at standard API rates. This bridge does NOT bypass Anthropic's subscription enforcement or billing — it is not a workaround for API access restrictions.

### Credits

- Bug diagnosis (#40) by @megayounus786.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Session creation race condition** — concurrent `startSession()` calls for the same name now check `_pendingSessions` before `sessions.has()`, preventing duplicate session creation
- **Streaming proxy timeout** — `handleStreamingResponse` now uses `fetchWithRetry` (1 retry) instead of bare `fetch`, preventing indefinite hangs on upstream failures
- **Swallowed errors in PersistentClaudeSession** — 7 empty `catch {}` blocks now log errors via `SESSION_EVENT.LOG` instead of silently ignoring them; process kill catches distinguish `ESRCH` (expected) from `EPERM` (logged)
- **Hook errors logged** — `_fireHook` catch block now emits error message instead of swallowing
- **Unsafe type casts** — removed `as unknown as` double casts in `openai-compat.ts` (body validation before cast, `usage` field added to chunk type) and `persistent-session.ts` (StreamEvent index signature makes direct cast valid)
- **`max_tokens` validation** — OpenAI-compat endpoint now rejects non-positive `max_tokens` with 400

## [2.9.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **CLI argument parsing** — comma-separated `--allowed-tools`, `--disallowed-tools`, `--add-dir`, `--mcp-config`, and `--betas` flags now trim whitespace and filter empty entries
- **API key sanitization** — stderr redaction now catches `sk-proj-*` and other `sk-*` key formats (previously only matched `sk-ant-*`)
- **Council worktree cleanup** — if a worktree creation fails mid-batch, already-created worktrees are cleaned up instead of left dangling
- **Council history pollution** — empty agent responses are now filtered from collaboration history prompts
- **Council TTL abort** — still-running councils are aborted at TTL expiry instead of silently deleted
- **Ultraplan TTL** — still-running ultraplans are marked as error at TTL expiry

### Added

- **`estimateTokens()`** — shared token estimation utility (`~4 chars/token`), replaces 3 inline duplicates across Codex/Gemini/Cursor sessions
- **`lookupModelStrict()`** — throws for unknown models instead of returning `undefined`
- **Pricing fallback warning** — `getModelPricing()` now logs a `console.warn` when falling back to default pricing for unknown models
- **Tests: `persistent-session.test.ts`** — 31 tests for Claude CLI engine (arg assembly, events, cost, send, stderr sanitization, stop)
- **Tests: `proxy-handler.test.ts`** — 17 tests for proxy handler (routing, retry, streaming, errors)
- **Tests: `embedded-server.test.ts`** — 22 tests for HTTP server (health, auth, rate limiting, body limits, routing, CORS, errors)

### Changed

- **Model detection** — deduplicated inline `CLAUDE_PATTERNS` arrays in `persistent-session.ts` and `session-manager.ts`; both now use centralized `isClaudeModel()` from `models.ts`

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Centralized model registry** (`src/models.ts`) — single source of truth for all 17 models across 4 providers. Model definitions, pricing, aliases, engine mappings, context windows, and `/v1/models` list are all auto-generated from one `MODELS[]` array. Adding a model is now a one-line change
- **Per-model context window** — `contextPercent` in session stats now uses the actual model's context window (e.g. 1M for Gemini, 256k for GPT-5.4) instead of a fixed 200k assumption
- **Session engine persistence** — `engine` field is now saved/restored across session restarts, so resumed sessions pick up the correct engine without re-specifying it
- **`x-session-reset` header** — OpenAI-compat endpoint now supports an explicit `x-session-reset: true` header to force a new conversation, in addition to the existing message-count heuristic
- **Proxy retry with backoff** — non-streaming proxy requests auto-retry on 429/5xx (up to 2 retries, exponential backoff, respects `Retry-After` header)
- **SSE heartbeat** — streaming responses (both OpenAI-compat and proxy) now send `:keepalive` comments every 15s to prevent proxy/client timeouts
- **Streaming usage** — final SSE chunk in OpenAI-compat streaming now includes `usage` (prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens)
- **Configurable rate limit** — `OPENCLAW_RATE_LIMIT` env var overrides the default per-IP rate limit

### Changed

- **`MAX_BODY_SIZE`** increased from 1 MB to 5 MB for larger request payloads
- **`RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`** increased from 100 to 300 per window
- **Error format consistency** — `/v1/*` routes now return OpenAI-standard `{ error: { message, type, code } }` format; internal routes keep `{ ok: false, error }` format
- **Proxy provider detection** — `resolveProvider` now correctly returns `'google'` (not `'gemini'`) as the provider name, matching the `ProviderName` type

### Removed

- **`CONTEXT_WINDOW_SIZE` constant** — replaced by per-model `getContextWindow()` from the model registry
- **Duplicate model definitions** — `MODEL_ENGINE_MAP` (openai-compat.ts), `resolveProviderModel` (handler.ts), `isGeminiModel`/`isClaudeModel` (anthropic-adapter.ts), `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING`/`MODEL_PRICING` (types.ts) all consolidated into `src/models.ts`

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **Model references updated to current flagships** — all code and docs now use current SOTA models: `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5.4-mini` (OpenAI), `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`/`gemini-3-flash-preview` (Google), `composer-2`/`composer-2-fast` (Cursor). Deprecated model names (`gpt-4o`, `cursor-small`, etc.) removed from docs and `/v1/models` list
- **Updated pricing table** — Opus 4.6 corrected to $5/$25, added GPT-5.4 series, Gemini 3.x, and Composer 2 pricing
- **Council default roles** — renamed default agents from model-based names (GPT/Claude/Gemini) to delivery-stage roles (Planner/Generator/Evaluator) with specialized personas aligned to the Plan → Build → Verify workflow. Engine mappings preserved: Planner→claude, Generator→gpt, Evaluator→gemini

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint** — drop-in backend for webchat apps (ChatGPT-Next-Web, Open WebUI, LobeChat, etc.). Stateful sessions maximize Anthropic prompt caching (90% discount on cached tokens). Supports streaming (SSE) and non-streaming responses
- **`/v1/models` endpoint** — lists supported models for OpenAI client discovery
- **Auto session management** — sessions created/reused per conversation via `X-Session-Id` header or `user` field. Auto-compact when context reaches 80%
- **Multi-engine model routing** — OpenAI `model` field auto-routes to the correct engine (claude/codex/gemini)
- **Configurable CORS** — `/v1/` paths allow cross-origin requests for remote webchat frontends; `OPENCLAW_CORS_ORIGINS=*` for all paths

## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Embedded server authentication** — opt-in bearer token via `OPENCLAW_SERVER_TOKEN` env var; written to `~/.openclaw/server-token` for CLI. `/health` exempt. Default: no auth (localhost binding is the primary boundary)
- **Orphaned process cleanup** — PID file tracking (`~/.openclaw/session-pids.json`) with startup cleanup. Verifies process command line matches known CLIs (claude/codex/gemini/agent) before killing to prevent PID reuse mishaps
- **Circuit breaker** — engine-level failure tracking with exponential backoff prevents cascading failures from broken CLIs
- **Rate limiting** — sliding-window rate limiter (100 req/min per IP) on embedded server
- **Council `defaultPermissionMode`** — new `CouncilConfig` option to override the `bypassPermissions` default for council agents
- **Shared constants module** — `src/constants.ts` consolidates 30+ magic numbers (timeouts, limits, thresholds) from across the codebase

### Changed

- **Council cleanup consolidation** — extracted `_cleanup()` method from `accept()` for reusable worktree/branch/file cleanup
- **Strongly typed event names** — `SESSION_EVENT` constant object replaces magic strings in event emission
- **Type cast fix** — eliminated `as unknown as` double cast in proxy handler registration

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Cursor Agent engine** — new `engine: 'cursor'` option wraps the Cursor Agent CLI (`agent`) with headless print mode, stream-json parsing, and full `ISession` interface support. Resolves #32
- `PersistentCursorSession` class (`src/persistent-cursor-session.ts`) implementing the same pattern as Codex/Gemini engines
- Unit tests for Cursor session (spawn flags, stream-json parsing, lifecycle, stderr sanitization)
- Cursor engine support in council agents — use `engine: 'cursor'` in agent personas for mixed-engine councils

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Zero-config proxy** — non-Claude models on the `claude` engine automatically start a local proxy server that converts Anthropic → OpenAI format and forwards to the OpenClaw gateway. Gateway port and auth are auto-detected from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. No env vars, no baseUrl, no config changes needed
- Proxy documentation in `skills/references/multi-engine.md`

### Fixed

- **Proxy model URL extraction** — `extractRealModel` regex fixed to handle Claude Code CLI's `/real/<model>/v1/messages` URL pattern
- **Gateway model name** — `forwardToGateway` now sends `model: "openclaw"` as required by gateway
- **HEAD request handling** — proxy returns 200 for CLI probe requests instead of JSON parse errors

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **Skill restructure** — SKILL.md rewritten from scratch: removed hardcoded local paths, migrated metadata from `clawdis` to `openclaw` format, install via `kind: "node"` npm package instead of local path
- **Docs moved into skill** — `docs/` directory moved to `skills/references/` for progressive disclosure. AI agents load reference files on demand instead of duplicating content. All README/CLAUDE.md links updated
- **Skill description** — comprehensive trigger keywords covering all 27 tools, multi-engine, council, ultraplan, ultrareview

### Removed

- `docs/` directory (content lives in `skills/references/` now)
- Hardcoded `~/clawd/claude-code-skill` path from skill metadata

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **Codex engine fully reworked** — migrated from `codex --full-auto --quiet` to `codex exec --full-auto --skip-git-repo-check -C <dir>`. Fixes `--quiet` rejection, `--cwd` rejection, TTY requirement, and git-repo-check in non-git directories (codex-cli 0.112.0+)
- **Gemini engine fake success** — non-zero exit codes (except 53/turn-limit) now correctly reject instead of resolving with empty output
- **Gemini prompt echo** — user-role messages from `stream-json` output are now filtered; only assistant responses are collected
- **Council consensus false positives** — removed loose tail-fallback heuristic that matched prompt instructions echoed back by agents. Only explicit `[CONSENSUS: YES/NO]` tags (and common variants) are accepted
- **Team tools fake execution** — `team_list` and `team_send` now reject with a clear error on non-Claude engines instead of sending raw text commands
- **Ultraplan error masking** — error responses (auth failures, empty output) no longer marked as `status: 'completed'` with error text in the `plan` field; correctly set `status: 'error'` with `error` field

### Added

- **Cross-engine team tools** — `team_list` and `team_send` now work on all engines. Claude uses native `/team` and `@teammate`; Codex/Gemini use SessionManager's cross-session messaging as a virtual team layer
- Engine Compatibility Matrix in README with tested CLI versions (Claude 2.1.91, Codex 0.118.0, Gemini 0.36.0)
- Known Limitations section in README
- Engine authentication prerequisites in docs/getting-started.md
- Full functional audit test script (`test-full-audit.ts`) — 47 tests covering all 27 tools across all 3 engines

### Changed

- Codex stdin set to `'ignore'` (was `'pipe'`) to prevent `codex exec` from waiting for piped input
- Consensus tail-fallback tests updated to match stricter parsing behavior

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Council post-processing lifecycle: `council_review`, `council_accept`, `council_reject` tools — completes the council workflow with structured review, cleanup, and rejection-with-feedback
- `CouncilReviewResult`, `CouncilAcceptResult`, `CouncilRejectResult` types for structured post-processing responses
- Council `accepted` and `rejected` status states

### Changed

- Translated `configs/council-system-prompt.md` from Chinese to English for project-wide consistency
- Translated all Chinese strings in `council.ts` agent prompts and CLAUDE.md worktree templates to English
- `openclaw.plugin.json` contracts.tools updated from 24 → 27

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Gemini CLI engine (`engine: 'gemini'`) — third engine alongside Claude Code and Codex. Per-message spawning with `--output-format stream-json` for real token usage tracking. Permission mapping: `bypassPermissions` → `--yolo`, `default` → `--sandbox` (#29)
- 88 new unit tests: SessionManager (74 tests, #28) and Gemini session (14 tests, #29). Total: 162 tests
- CLAUDE.md project context file for contributors
- README architecture diagram (mermaid), test badge, "Why not Claude API" callout

### Fixed

- Test files no longer compiled to `dist/` or shipped in npm package (tsconfig exclude)
- `openclaw.plugin.json` contracts.tools updated from 10 → 24 to match actual registered tools
- `SessionManagerLike` interface in council.ts uses real types instead of `Record<string, unknown>`
- CI switched from `npm install` to `npm ci` with committed lockfile for reproducible builds
- docs/cli.md: added SDK-only tools reference table (14 tools without CLI wrappers)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Plugin installation blocked on OpenClaw 2026.3.31 — resolved security scanner false positive for "credential harvesting" in CLI by deferring env var access (#24)
- Added `openclaw.hooks` declaration to prevent hook pack validation error
- Added `capabilities.childProcess` and `capabilities.networkAccess` to plugin manifest for scanner whitelisting

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Session Inbox — cross-session messaging with `claude_session_send_to`, `claude_session_inbox`, `claude_session_deliver_inbox`. Idle sessions receive immediately; busy sessions queue for later delivery. Broadcast via `"*"` (#22)
- Ultraplan — dedicated Opus planning session (up to 30 min) with `ultraplan_start`, `ultraplan_status` (#22)
- Ultrareview — fleet of 5-20 specialized reviewer agents in parallel via council system with `ultrareview_start`, `ultrareview_status`. 20 review angles: security, logic, performance, types, concurrency, etc. (#22)
- Tool count: 17 → 24

### Fixed

- Session creation race condition — concurrent `startSession()` calls no longer create duplicates (#23)
- File persistence error handling — proper error callbacks, orphan `.tmp` cleanup on rename failure (#23)
- HTTP stream reader leak — `try/finally { reader.cancel() }` on all streaming paths (#23)
- CORS restricted to localhost origins only (#23)
- Agent name validation prevents git branch injection (#23)
- CWD path normalization via `path.resolve()` (#23)
- Session resume logic uses `??` instead of `||` for explicit null handling (#23)
- Stderr API key sanitization masks `sk-ant-*`, `*_API_KEY=*`, `Bearer *` patterns (#23)
- Council git errors now logged instead of silently swallowed (#23)
- SKILL.md cleaned up: removed 8 references to unimplemented CLI commands (#23)
- README tool count and CLI version accuracy (#23)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Stream output support — `onChunk` callback and `stream` param for `claude_session_send` (#9)
- Session persistence — registry saved to `~/.openclaw/claude-sessions.json` with 7-day disk TTL, atomic writes, debounced saves (#11)
- Dynamic tool/model switching — `claude_session_update_tools` and `claude_session_switch_model` with rollback on failure (#12)
- Session health overview — `claude_sessions_overview` tool for plugin-wide stats (#10)
- Premature CLI exit detection — startup crash no longer leaves sessions stuck in busy state (#13)

### Fixed

- Stale close listener on fallback ready path (follow-up to #13)
- Truncated code comments in startup flow

### Improved

- Project governance: CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, issue/PR templates, CI workflows, npm publish automation

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Cross-platform PATH inheritance from `process.env.PATH`

- Lazy initialization — zero memory when unused

### Fixed

- `contextPercent` calculation (was hardcoded 0)
- Process blocking on detached child (`proc.unref()`)
- Ready event now listens for CLI init signal instead of blind 2s timeout

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
